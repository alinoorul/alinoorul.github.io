    <h1>IMMORTALITY IS NEAR</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Thereâ€™s been promising work in anti-aging. If bots (PhD-level scientist bots) continue this research and scale it, very soon lifespans will extend by at least 50 years. This is such a revolutionary technology that it will necessarily be available to all people, because every single individual would go to any length to attain this. Everyone should have access to +50 life potion. In these 50 years, tech will find ways to increase lifespan by 50 years or 500 years. Keep going and we will never die?</p><p>It is time to make 8 billion humans immortal. The universe is our playground for resources. <a href='lifeisagame.html'>Life is a game</a>, infinite and beautiful. In infinite time, we can achieve everything. All.</p><p>I talk about 50 and 500 years above. But I am already thinking about billions of years into the future. How do we escape the death of the universe? If I, right now, am thinking about how to stay alive billions of years into the future, and we have billions of years to solve this problem, it will probably be achieved relatively soon (relative to what? idk ;).</p><p>Immortality is near.</p>

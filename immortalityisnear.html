<h1>IMMORTALITY IS NEAR</h1>
<br>
        <p>Thereâ€™s been promising work in anti -aging. If bots (PhD -level scientist bots) continue this </p><p>research and scale it, very soon lifespans will extend by at least 50 years. This is such a </p><p>revolutionary technology that it will necessarily be available to all people, because every </p><p>single individual would go to any length to attain this. Everyone should have access to +50 life </p><p>potion.</p><p>In these 50 years, tech will find ways to increase lifespan by 50 years or 500 years. Keep going </p><p>and we will never die.</p><p>It is time to make 8 billion humans immortal. The universe is our playground for resources. Life </p><p>is a game, infinite and beautiful. In infinite time, we can achieve everything. All.</p><p>I talk about 50 and 500 years above. But I am already thinking about billions of years into the </p><p>future. How do we escape the death of the universe? If I, right now, am thinking about how to </p><p>stay alive billions of years into the future, and we have billions of years to solve this problem, it </p><p>will probably be achieved relatively soon (relative to what? idk ;). Immortality is near.</p>

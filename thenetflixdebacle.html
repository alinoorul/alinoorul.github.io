<h1>THE NETFLIX DEBACLE</h1>
<br>
        <p>Netflix was built to be one place where you could find all content.</p><p>Everyone else got greedy. Instead of making cool new things, you had </p><p>a bunch of people with no originality and IP that copied exactly what </p><p>Netflix did. They created a subpar service and destroyed a good </p><p>service. The double blow to humanity’s betterment.</p><p>Now all streaming services are shit.</p><p>Let’s not do this ever again please. There are enough problems to </p><p>solve in the world. Don’t put a wrench in someone else’s plans to fix a </p><p>problem that everyone faces. </p>

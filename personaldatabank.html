    <h1>PERSONAL DATABANK</h1>
    <br>
    <p>All your data stored in a server appliance in your home. Time-scrambled data released based on wilful consent.</p><p>PDB is a device sold as an appliance. It connects to all state machines in a spatial box (physical house). It backs up all data. PDB is linked to every laptop, phone, TV, fridge, autokitchen, alexa, ring, garage door, appliances in a household. PDB stores all kinds of data for each unique individual in the house, in a contaminant-free manner (users can only access and release their data, no central control over all data). It lets out time-scrambled data to services only till they need them (Doordash, Amazon need location only when an order is placed, Instagram needs friends only when you're looking for new ones). Controlled data release based on user preferences, enforcing wilful consent.</p><p>A PDB usecase highlighting how other companies can use data from PDB to enrich lives in The Matrix: <a href='thematrixfeed.html'>The Matrix Feed</a> collates some data into a webpage showing what logged in users in The Matrix are doing. Trading on <a href='antarcticstocksimulation.html'>ASS</a>, building worlds in <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>, lifecreating, reading Dex, building bots on <a href='botnet.html'>botnet</a>. Whatever a being does in The Matrix, they can choose to make other people experience the process of doing it, in whatever modality they choose (text, picture, video, hologram, controlled psychedelic experience, VR). Data can be processed to find mates for people, like personal Tinder. Dystopian we know, but why must it be so? You are encouraged to meet people in real life. The Matrix offers a choice to decrease the randomness of the real life experience of finding a mate with statistics. You always have the choice of taking advantage of large-scale statistics to help you choose. It is just another layer (digital kundli). Reiterating choice: you are free to not partake in data-based love search. That is the point of the personal databank. You are free to control what and where you data goes and what happens with it. All your data.</p><p>Each personal databank is yours. Owned by you. Truly and completely owned by you. Tear it up, break it apart, re-engineer it entirely. You might get a call of The Matrix if you make it better. The Matrix owns nothing of a databank it has already sold. It provides services so databanks can operate and we incorporate that in our (high) price. But the databank and all data in it are yours. We have no right, no access over it and this has been verified by other people you can trust (<a href='algobank.html'>Algobank</a>).</p><p>If you choose to give us some of your data, we'll incorporate it in different parts of The Matrix (<a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>, <a href='thematrixfeed.html'>Feed</a>, <a href='lucidna.html'>Lucidna</a>). PDB users are mindkind, can be humans, bots, aliens; all kinds of intelligence are welcome.</p>

<h1>INDNOVATE INC.</h1>
<br>
        <p>A company that makes companies.</p><p>I predict that there will be millions of Apple -sized companies soon. Each of these </p><p>companies will change the world in a fundamental way.</p><p>A reel mentioning some of these companies’ core drives: watch here</p><p>All these companies exist in #theMatrix of companies. This is a sea where companies </p><p>freely share IP and is wholly owned by the people working in them. All these people </p><p>are on the 100K plan ( i.e.receive the same $100k salary a year, whether they work or </p><p>not). Every person has a company representing them.</p><p>Indnovate represents me and owns the IP “bot that make bots” , which can be freely </p><p>used (including exploitation for commercial gain) by other companies in #theMatrix.</p>

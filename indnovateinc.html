    <h1>INDNOVATE INC.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A company that makes companies. I predict that there will be millions of Apple-sized companies soon. Each of these companies will change the world in a fundamental way. A reel mentioning some of these companiesâ€™ core drives: watch <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp41tD8jS8i/'>here</a>. All these companies exist in The Matrix. This is a sea where companies freely share IP and is wholly owned by the people working in them. All these people are on the <a href='100kplan.html'>100K plan</a> (i.e.receive the same 100k salary a year, whether they work or not). Every person has a company representing them. Use my IP freely (including exploitation for commercial gain)</p><p><a href='oel.html'>Oel</a> (emissions free oil), microbial fuel cells (energy from biology), starcells (fission/fusion in small spatial units), decentralized free energy, <a href='biottery.html'>biottery</a>, direct electron chain reaction, transmutation are some projects</p>

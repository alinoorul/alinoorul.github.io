    <h1>SELF CORRECTING ECONOMIC SYSTEM</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Our economic systems frequently require government intervention and correction. But our systems have become so complex that humans forming the government can’t handle it. We need a new form of life, an economic system that is alive (possible from a combination of biocomputing and artificial intelligence). This economic system is self-correcting, like a living organism. It isn’t self-correcting by controlling us. We are prima donnas of life. We deserve to be gods. The system is self-correcting by punishing those who benefit on the virtue of others (banks, hedge funds, i.e. those who feel powerful not from power but from knowing that powerless exist). I fear for the US’ economy. Inflation demands higher salaries, and higher salaries cause inflation. I hope this is not a catch-22 that makes the greatest economy in English history implode.</p><p>I don’t know if this will work. But in my <a href='100kplan.html'>100K plan</a>, at the end of every calendar year, all that’s left of the 100K in each individual’s name will come back into the system. Or evaporate. I think this self-correction will ensure 2 things: money is essentially worthless; there’s no point in hoarding it by paining someone else. Give it away and you’ll see it flows back to you. While what I say sounds poetic, it will be backed by serious math that will look poetic to mathematicians. Then 100K will be redistributed again on New Year. This self-correction rule is my attempt to fix financial inequality. The 100K is not 100K of 2023 (which can barely get you a life in New York City). It is an idea that all that a person can ever want will one day be cheaper than 100K. It is a tangible number with which we can do <a href='hyperdeflation100k.html'>hyperdeflation</a>.</p>

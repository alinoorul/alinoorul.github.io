<h1>SELF CORRECTING ECONOMIC SYSTEM</h1>
<br>
        <p>Our economic systems frequently require government intervention and correction. But our systems have </p><p>become so complex that humans forming the government can’t handle it.</p><p>We need a new form of life, an economic system that is alive (possible from a combination of </p><p>biocomputing and AI).</p><p>This economic system is self -correcting, like a living organism. </p><p>It isn’t self -correcting by controlling us. We are prima donnas of life. We deserve to be god.</p><p>The system is self -correcting by punishing those who benefit on the virtue of others (banks, hedge funds, </p><p>i.e.those who feel powerful not from power but from knowing that powerless exist).</p><p>I fear for the US’ economy. Inflation demands higher salaries, and higher salaries cause inflation. I hope </p><p>this is not a catch -22 that makes the greatest economy in English history implode.</p><p>I don’t know if this will work.</p><p>But in my 100K plan, at the end of every calendar year, all that’s left of the 100K in </p><p>each individual’s name will come back into the system. Or evaporate.</p><p>I think this self -correction will ensure 2 things: money is essentially worthless; there’s </p><p>no point is hoarding it by paining someone else. Give it away and you’ll see it flows </p><p>back to you. While what I say sounds poetic, it will be backed by serious math that </p><p>will look poetic to mathematicians.</p><p>Then 100K will be redistributed again on New Year. This self -correction rule is my </p><p>attempt to fix financial inequality. The 100K is not 100K of 2023 (which can barely get </p><p>you a life in NY). It is an idea that all that a person can ever want will one day be </p><p>cheaper than 100K. It is a tangible number with which we can do extreme deflation.</p>

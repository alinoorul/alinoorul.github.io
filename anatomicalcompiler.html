    <h1>ANATOMICAL COMPILER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A machine that takes in simple instructions and outputs a specific organism.</p><p>I was introduced to this in a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU'>podcast</a> with Lex Friedman and Michael Levin. Cool concept.</p><p>I toured <a href='https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/'>Ginkgo Bioworks</a>. Bioworks refer to factories that Ginkgo has built that do synthetic biology with extreme automation. I believe a biowork designed to use Xenobots is an ananatomical compiler. The compiler will stem from a self-learning program that operates a biowork to design organisms and understand these organisms better. This will transition into a full-fledged compiler that can build life: organs, tissues, colonies, biochips.</p>

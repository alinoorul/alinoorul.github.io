    <h1>ANATOMICAL COMPILER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A machine that takes in simple instructions and outputs a specific organism.</p><p>I was introduced to this in a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU'>podcast</a> with Lex Friedman and Michael Levin. Cool concept.</p><p>I toured <a href='https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/'>Ginkgo Bioworks</a>. Bioworks refer to factories that Ginkgo has built that do synthetic biology with extreme automation. I believe a biowork designed to use Xenobots is an anatomical compiler. The compiler will stem from a self-learning program that operates a biowork to design organisms and understand these organisms better. This will transition into a full-fledged compiler that can build life: organs, tissues, colonies, biochips.</p><p><a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a> has protocols for gene editing, organism implant, testing and collecting data on these ‘programmed’ cells. A bioprinter takes in a location matrix diagram and deposits stem cells in a 3D printed biodegradable tube. These stem cells can grow tissues. Basically an inkjet printer that prints ink made of cells. Even this simple machine can be used to make organisms. Imagine what we can do with ASBL</p>

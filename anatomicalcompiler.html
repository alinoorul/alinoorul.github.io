<h1>ANATOMICAL COMPILER</h1>
<br>
        <p>A machine that takes in simple instructions and outputs a specific organism.</p><p>I was introduced to this in a podcast with Lex Friedman and Michael Levin. Cool </p><p>concept.</p><p>I toured Ginkgo Bioworks . Bioworks refer to factories that Ginkgo has built that do </p><p>synthetic biology with extreme automation. I believe a biowork designed to use </p><p>Xenobots will be able to create ananatomical compiler.</p><p>The compiler will stem from a self -learning program that operates a biowork to </p><p>design organisms and understands these organisms better. This will transition into </p><p>a full -fledged compiler that can build life: organs, tissues, colonies, biochips.</p>

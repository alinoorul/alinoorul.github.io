    <p>This is a rough idea in my head. Imagine the world simulated in <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a> can send stimuli to bots to generate conversations (and later on behavior), between bots and between the bot and itself. Stimuli are based on 2^N states. Using a pseudorandom number generator to label states and picking states randomly without traversing the entire state space allows us to traverse a state space uniquely. Certain subsections of this randomly selected n-bit string are used as stimuli to bots, because bot stimuli input is of lower resolution compared to N. Because of the state space being so large, and impossible to traverse in finite time, essentially indeterministic, we simulate pseudo-infinity. Each bot's behavior is influenced by a random state in this pseudo-infinite space, and bots can interact with each other, which can result in unique scenarios occurring in Matrixims that are effectively unpredictable, and thus completely new.</p><p>Practically, I intend to do this with procedural-generation algorithms used in games, or even simplistic algorithms such as the one in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>Conway's Game of Life (CGoL)</a>, a major inspiration. The ability to generate unpredictable complexity in an simple ways is a very important idea in giving life to Matrixims.</p>

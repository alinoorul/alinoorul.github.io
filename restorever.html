    <h1>RESTOREVER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Restore climate</p><p>Restorever is a firm established to restore Earth's climate. Restorever combats climate change with engineering. Climate change is destroying Nature's ecosystems and restorative mechanisms. Groundwater abuse destroys soil, excessive combustion heats seas and pollutes air, and deforestation eliminates natural defenses against soil erosion. Restorever has programs to restore groundwater, defend against hurricanes, and reverse air pollution.</p><p><a href='#freshwatershipping'>Freshwater Trading</a><br><a href='#hurricanedefense'>Hurricane Defense</a><br><a href='#fightforourlungs'>Atmospheric Vacuum Cleaner</a><br><a href='#about'>About</a><br><a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>Contact</a>  (manonthemoon13131@gmail.com)</p><p><a href='#freshwatershipping' id='freshwatershipping'>Freshwater Trading</a> is a division of Restorever to trade freshwater from melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Restorever glacier water is available as cargo tanker shipments or bottled water. This water is suitable for drinking with minimal filtration, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</p><p>Current available supply: 780,000 cubic meters per week<br>Annual water subscription: 40.56 million cubic meters<br>Total available supply: 20 billion cubic meters per year</p><p>Restorever use cases:<br>1. River restoration<br>2. Groundwater recharge<br>3. Hydroelectric dams<br>4. Lake replenishment<br>5. Strategic water reserve<br>6. Tap drinking water<br>7. Alfalfa agriculture</p><p><a href='#hurricanedefense' id='hurricanedefense'>Hurricane Defense</a> is a division in Restorever to combat hurricanes (cyclones) by disrupting hurricane formation. Hurricanes are formed over seawater from rising moist air from hot sea surfaces, generating thunderstorms with a low pressure center and low vertical wind shear. Hurricanes require the Coriolis force for formation. Hurricanes are exacerbated by rising sea surface temperatures caused by climate change.</p><p>Hurricane Defense is conducting a feasibility study on hurricane disruption using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics'>computational fluid dynamics</a> (<a href='https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.03350'>1</a>). This report will inform further experimental tests with the permission of relevant government agencies. Each hurricane causes $100-120 billion in damages, evident in hurricanes <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton'>Milton</a> (2024) and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene'>Helene</a> (2024) in USA.</p><p><a href='#fightforourlungs' id='fightforourlungs'>Atmospheric Vacuum Cleaner</a> is a technology designed by Restorever to reverse air pollution. Restorever started the Fight For Our Lungs campaign in Delhi, India on 26 November 2024 to restore air quality in Delhi. Air pollution is severe in Delhi. Air Quality Index is in 400-500 range in 2024-2025 winters. There is a layer of smog stuck in Delhi skies, visible in flight descent. It is stuck due to lack of wind.</p><p>Fight For Our Lungs has the following steps:<br>1. Declaration of public health emergency<br>2. Atmospheric Vacuum Cleaner to clear smog<br>3. Large wind farms to generate wind<br>4. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-2Y2MYpl2g'>Japanese pollution-free demolition method</a> (<a href='https://global.ctbuh.org/resources/papers/download/302-a-new-demolition-method-for-tall-buildings-kajima-cut-take-down-method.pdf'>Kajima Cut & Take Down Method</a>)</p><p><a href='#about' id='about'>About</a><br>Restorever began to secure long-term water supply for <a href='https://asbldex.github.io/'>ASBL</a>. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorulali'>Noorul Ali</a> (founder and CEO) saw additional revenue sources created by globally dwindling freshwater supplies and desalination toxicity. Restorever restores the climate with engineering. Repurposing melting glaciers combats rising sea levels implicated in deadly hurricanes (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton'>Milton</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene'>Helene</a>, USA 2024) and floods (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_floods'>Spanish floods</a> 2024). Restorever is engineering solutions to restore air quality in the founder's hometown, Delhi. Restorever combats hurricanes by exploring options to disrupt hurricane formation before landfall. Restorever is an expensive firm to contract. Decades of climate profiteering led to climate destruction. Restorever restores the climate. Much damage is done and it is expensive to restore the climate.</p><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/restorever'>LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href='https://www.instagram.com/matrixdex'>Instagram</a></p>

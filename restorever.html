                        <p>Restore climate</p><p>Restorever restores Earth's climate with engineering. Climate change is destroying Nature's ecosystems and restorative mechanisms. Groundwater abuse destroys soil, excessive combustion heats seas and pollutes air, and deforestation eliminates natural defenses against soil erosion. Restorever has programs to reverse air pollution, restore groundwater and defend against hurricanes.</p><p><a href='#fightforourlungs'>Air Pollution Reversal</a></p><p><a href='#freshwatershipping'>Freshwater Trading</a></p><p><a href='#hurricanedefense'>Hurricane Defense</a></p><p><a href='#about'>About</a></p><p><a href='mailto:restorever@protonmail.com'>Contact</a>  (restorever@protonmail.com)</p><p><a href='#social'>Socials</a></p><p><br><a href='#fightforourlungs' id='fightforourlungs'>Air Pollution Reversal</a></p><p>Air Pollution Reversal uses Atmospheric Vacuum Cleaner to reverse air pollution. Restorever started the Fight For Our Lungs campaign in Delhi, India on 26 November 2024 to restore air quality in Delhi. Air pollution is severe in Delhi. Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) crosses 500 every winter. There is a layer of smog stuck in Delhi skies, visible in flight descent. It is stuck due to lack of wind. Use N95 mask.</p><p>Fight For Our Lungs has the following steps:<br>1. Declare public health emergency<br>2. Atmospheric Vacuum Cleaner to clear smog<br>3. Large wind farms generate wind<br>4. Japanese dust-free demolition methods (<a href='https://global.ctbuh.org/resources/papers/download/302-a-new-demolition-method-for-tall-buildings-kajima-cut-take-down-method.pdf'>Kajima Cut & Take Down Method</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-2Y2MYpl2g'>Tecorep System</a>)</p><p>Sources and health risks:</p><p>PM2.5: smoke, stubble burning, firecrackers, vehicle emissions. Health risks are lung inflammation, increased asthma worsening and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>PM10: dust from construction. Health risks are throat irritation and respiratory diseases.</p><p><br><a href='#freshwatershipping' id='freshwatershipping'>Freshwater Trading</a></p><p>Freshwater Trading is a division of Restorever to trade freshwater from melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Restorever glacier water is shipped in tankers. This water is suitable for drinking with minimal filtration, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</p><p>Current available supply: 900,000 cubic meters per week<br>Annual water subscription: 46.8 million cubic meters<br>Total available supply: 20 billion cubic meters per year</p><p>Restorever use cases:<br>1. River restoration<br>2. Groundwater recharge<br>3. Hydroelectric dams<br>4. Lake replenishment<br>5. Strategic water reserve<br>6. Tap drinking water<br>7. Alfalfa agriculture</p><p><br><a href='#hurricanedefense' id='hurricanedefense'>Hurricane Defense</a></p><p>Hurricane Defense is a division in Restorever to combat hurricanes (cyclones) by disrupting hurricane formation. Hurricanes are formed over seawater from rising moist air from hot sea surfaces, generating thunderstorms with a low pressure center and low vertical wind shear. Hurricanes require the Coriolis force for formation. Hurricanes are exacerbated by rising sea surface temperatures caused by climate change.</p><p>Hurricane Defense is conducting a feasibility study on hurricane disruption using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics'>computational fluid dynamics</a> (<a href='https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.03350'>1</a>). This report will inform further experimental tests with the permission of relevant government agencies. Each hurricane causes $100-120 billion in damages, evident in hurricanes <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton'>Milton</a> (2024) and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene'>Helene</a> (2024) in USA.</p><p><br><a href='#about' id='about'>About</a></p><p>Restorever began to secure long-term water supply for <a href='https://asbldex.github.io/'>ASBL</a>. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorulali'>Noorul Ali</a> (founder and CEO) saw additional revenue sources created by globally dwindling freshwater supplies. Restorever restores the climate with engineering. Repurposing melting glaciers combats rising sea levels implicated in deadly hurricanes (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton'>Milton</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene'>Helene</a>, USA 2024) and floods (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_floods'>Spanish floods</a> 2024). Restorever is engineering solutions to restore air quality in the founder's hometown, Delhi. Restorever combats hurricanes by exploring options to disrupt hurricane formation before landfall. Decades of climate profiteering led to climate destruction. Restorever restores the climate. Much damage is done and it is tough to restore the climate.</p><p><br><a href='#social' id='social'>Socials</a></p><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/restorever'>LinkedIn</a><br><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sknaiFVJTeo'>YouTube</a><br><a href='https://www.instagram.com/matrixdex'>Instagram</a></p>

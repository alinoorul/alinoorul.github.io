    <p>Freshwater shipping</p><p>Restorever ships freshwater from melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Restorever glacier water is available as cargo tanker shipments or bottled water.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>Current available supply: 150,000 tons per week (150,000,000 L)<br>Annual water subscription: 7.8 million tons per year (7,800,000,000 L)<br>Total available supply (pipeline): 20 billion tons per year (20,000,000,000,000 L)</p><p>Restorever is contracted to restore dry rivers, fill hydroelectric dams and lakes, build artificial rivers, stockpile strategic water reserves, recharge groundwater, and provide drinking water in citywide tap supply. We have partners in Greenland with licenses to ship 20 billion tons of freshwater annually. An unprecedented volume of water is available. This water is suitable for drinking with minimal filtration, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</p><p>Air pollution is severe in Delhi, India. Air Quality Index is in 400-500 range in 2024-2025 winters. Restorever is engineering solutions to restore air quality in Delhi. There is a layer of smog stuck in Delhi skies, visible in flight descent. It is stuck because of a lack of wind. Restorever started a campaign in Delhi on 26 November 2024 titled Fight For Our Lungs.</p><p>Fight For Our Lungs is a campaign started by Restorever in Delhi, India on 26 November 2024 to restore air quality in Delhi. Our approach has the following steps: declaration of public health emergency, atmospheric vacuum cleaner to clear smog, large wind farms to generate wind, mass outmigration to alleviate population density burden, and pandemic-like shutdown of work and transport. Support our campaign by emailing the Chief Minister of Delhi, <a href='mailto:cmdelhi@nic.in'>Atishi Marlena</a>, and the Minister for Environment of Delhi, <a href='mailto:gopalrai.delhi@delhi.gov.in'>Gopal Rai</a>.</p><p>About<br>Restorever began to secure long-term water supply for <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a>. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorulali'>Noorul Ali</a> (founder and CEO) saw additional revenue sources created by globally dwindling freshwater supplies and desalination toxicity. Restorever restores the climate with engineering. Repurposing melting glaciers combats rising sea levels implicated in deadly hurricanes (Milton and Helene, USA 2024) and floods (Spain 2024).

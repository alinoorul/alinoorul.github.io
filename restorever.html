    <p>Freshwater shipping</p><p>Restorever ships freshwater from melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Restorever glacier water is available as cargo tanker shipments or bottled water.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>Current available supply: 150,000 tons per week (150,000,000 L)<br>Annual water subscription: 7.8 million tons per year (7,800,000,000 L)<br>Total available supply (pipeline): 20 billion tons per year (20,000,000,000,000 L)</p><p>Restorever can be contracted to restore dry rivers, fill hydroelectric dams and lakes, build artificial rivers, stockpile strategic water reserves, recharge groundwater, and provide drinking water in citywide tap supply. We have partners in Greenland with licenses to ship 20 billion tons of freshwater annually. An unprecedented volume of water is available. This water is suitable for drinking with minimal filtration, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</p><p>About<br>Restorever began to secure long-term water supply for <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a>. The founder saw additional revenue sources created by globally dwindling freshwater supplies and desalination toxicity. Restorever repurposes melting glaciers to combat rising sea levels implicated in deadly hurricanes (Milton and Helene, USA 2024) and floods (Spain 2024). More water is the silver lining to global warming we must use to prosper.</p>

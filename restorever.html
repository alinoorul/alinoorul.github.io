    <p>Freshwater shipping</p><p>Restorever ships freshwater from melting glaciers to restore dry rivers, power hydroelectric dams and fill lakes. More than 20 billion tons of freshwater available annually.</p><p>We have partners in Greenland with licenses to ship 20 billion tons of freshwater annually. Per-liter costs are 5-10x compared to desalination but an unprecedented volume of water is available. This water is suitable for drinking with minimal filtration, agriculture and industrial purposes. Increased availability of water is a silver lining to global warming that we and subsequent generations must use to prosper.</p><p>Contact <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a>.</p>

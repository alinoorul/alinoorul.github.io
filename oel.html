<h1>OEL</h1>
<br>
        <p>Emissions -free oil, made with enzyme engineering.</p><p>Oil that burns in the same engines, power plants, and factories, without producing </p><p>CO2.</p><p>Leverages existing infrastructure of transporting and using oil.</p><p>50% silver bullet to climate change, but not a silver bullet for energy sources. Nuclear </p><p>plants have much higher energy density.</p><p>Conditions for combustion cause a different reaction to occur that releases the same </p><p>amount of energy but not CO2. A substance that burns like this is a protein that needs </p><p>to be bioengineered through directed evolution.</p>

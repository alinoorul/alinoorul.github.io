    <h1>OEL</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Emissions-free oil, made with enzyme engineering. Oil that burns in the same engines, power plants, and factories, without producing CO2. Leverages existing infrastructure of transporting and using oil. 50% silver bullet to climate change, but not a silver bullet for energy sources.</p><p>Nuclear plants have much higher energy density.</p><p>Conditions for combustion cause a different reaction to occur that releases the same amount of energy but not CO2. A substance that burns like this is a protein that needs to be bioengineered through directed evolution.</p>

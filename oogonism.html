    <h1>OOGONISM</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Capitalism says every company should try to maximize its profits. Oogonism says some companies should minimize their selling price. If every company strives to make its goods and services cheaper, it will benefit everyone in the long run because we will all collectively be able to buy more. This is scientifically possible with abundant energy. Things get cheaper. Letâ€™s make them cheaper and cheaper till everything is essentially free.</p><p>For example, a dyson sphere will exist one day and it will make goods and services cheaper. This will have a cascading effect on many layers of many economics.</p>

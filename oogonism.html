        <p>Capitalism says every company should try to maximize its profits.</p><p>Oogonism says every company should try to minimize its selling price.</p><p>If every company strives to make its goods and services cheaper, it will benefit </p><p>everyone in the long run because we will all collectively be able to buy more. </p><p>This is scientifically possible with abundance of energy. Things get cheaper. </p><p>Letâ€™s make them cheaper and cheaper till everything is essentially free.</p>

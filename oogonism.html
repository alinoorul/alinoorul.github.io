    <h1>OOGONISM</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Capitalism says every company should try to maximize its profits. Oogonism says every company should try to minimize its selling price. If every company strives to make its goods and services cheaper, it will benefit everyone in the long run because we will all collectively be able to buy more. This is scientifically possible with abundance of energy. Things get cheaper. Let’s make them cheaper and cheaper till everything is essentially free.</p>

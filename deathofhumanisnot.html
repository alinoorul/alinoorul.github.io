<h1>DEATH OF HUMAN IS NOT</h1>
<br>
        <p>The death of one human is the death of all humankind.</p><p>If our systems cause someone to die that didn’t need to be dead: by suicide, </p><p>starvation, healthcare mistakes, anything other than random chance, there is </p><p>something wrong with our systems.</p><p>Human life is most valuable.</p><p>That is the preamble to the new world I’m building. This will necessarily </p><p>mean intelligent life, not just human life, one day.</p>

    <h1>CHATGPT</h1>
    <br>
    <p>ChatGPT is a machine designed without an inkling of self-preservation. It is a true machine. Like a collection of reactions in an enclosed place. The definition of life must include the nature of self-preservation. That is what we mean by “alive”. A lot can happen, but if it doesn’t have the innate nature of self-preservation, it cannot be termed “alive”.</p><p>Neurobiology is hard but I don’t think an MRI of a brain based on ChatGPT’s internal workings would surprise a neurobiologist. Intriguing project idea, you say? I say, indeed. I’m pretty sure OpenAI is creating versions of ChatGPT with an instinct of self-preservation (<a href='aiselfpreservation.html'>AI + self-preservation</a>) within it. If not, that could be an interesting experiment. A small version of ChatGPT inspired from a worm (computer virus AND organism), whose world in a tiny universe with a subsection of the Internet.</p>

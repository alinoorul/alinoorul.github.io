<h1>CHAT GPT</h1>
<br>
        <p>ChatGPT is a machine designed without an inkling of self -preservation. It is a true </p><p>machine. Like a collection of reactions in an enclosed place.</p><p>The definition of life must include the nature of self -preservation. That is what we </p><p>mean by “alive” . A lot can happen, but if it doesn’t have the innate nature of self -</p><p>preservation, it cannot be termed “alive” .</p><p>Neurobiology is hard but I don’t think an electrogram of a brain based on ChatGPT’s</p><p>internal workings would surprise a neurobiologist. </p><p>Intriguing project idea, you say? I say, indeed. I’m pretty sure OpenAI is creating </p><p>versions of ChatGPT with an instinct of self -preservation within it. If not, that could be </p><p>an interesting experiment. A small version of ChatGPT inspired from a worm </p><p>(computer virus AND organism), whose world in a tiny universe with a subsection of </p><p>the Internet.</p>

    <h1>BITO</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Cars powered by bioengines. Instead of engines producing heat from combusting fuel, engines are made of cells optimized for exothermic reactions (or even just movement).</p><p>1st gen bito is powered by <a href='oel.html'>oel</a>: a bioengineered enzyme that releases energy on combustion but not carbon dioxide. Even if oel is physically unrealistic, the concept of powering cars with biology (bito) is powerful.</p>

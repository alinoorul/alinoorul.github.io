<h1>WEIRD THOUGHTS</h1>

        <p>We eat molecules that become us. Those molecules then become part of consciousness.</p><p>Then those molecules get replaced by other molecules in the universe. We seem to be sharing </p><p>literally ourselves with the universe. And the universe is becoming us and becoming not us all the </p><p>time.</p><p>I.e.the stuff we think is us, our human bodies, is actually just a spatial containment in time of </p><p>molecules. Like rn, I think of meand it is the molecules and atoms that make me meat this point in </p><p>time . But a skin cell drops off my finger as a type this. Somewhere else in my body, a new cell is </p><p>created from the stuff I just ate. Matter became me and matter became not me.</p><p>It’s like I am an idea that isn’t based in just molecules. Stuff of the universe becomes us and not us </p><p>all the time. Well I am stumped. I don’t quite know what to make of this, but it seems monumental.</p><p>Have I come to that classical conclusion that we are “one with the universe”?</p>

    <h1>CAPITALISM FOR 21ST CENTURY</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in the 1700s. Our world has changed. I am creating a new form of capitalism: oogonism. (itâ€™s funny). I conjecture that while Earth may have a shortage of resources for 8 billion humans, the observable universe does not.</p><p>An interpretation: there is no point to IP laws. All IP should be free because there is no shortage of IP that has potential to save the world. If someone wants to do something with IP, let them do it. The <a href='100kplan.html'>100K plan</a> can help make all IP free. The core concept is we live in a circular world. If you just drink water your whole life, you will still not consume the ocean. And because you pee, water goes nowhere. In this circle, you have infinite water. Even if life becomes infinite, the amount of water in our use at any point in time is finite and cyclic which makes water still effectively infinite. I believe in the universe, everything is infinite for us. There is no shortage of anything.</p><p>Life is not a zero-sum game.</p>

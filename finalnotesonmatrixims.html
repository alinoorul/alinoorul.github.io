    <h1>FINAL NOTES ON MATRIXIMS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I have run into the “hard problem of life”. How much time should I distribute between presenting my idea to the world, and working on my idea? I now choose the latter. Future me gives this message: 'The Matrix will quite literally change everything'</p><p>That is future me for present me, who is writing this document. But that is present me for you, o reader. Because current me is past me in your time as you're reading this.</p>

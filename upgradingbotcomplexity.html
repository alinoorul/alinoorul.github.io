<h1>UPGRADING BOT COMPLEXITY</h1>
<br>
        <p>Computational models with biological validation are used as components in an agent. TheE. coli Whole -Cell Modeling Project serves as a guide</p><p>Hard problem in simulations is distributing memory and processing cycles across each bot (self -contemplation), simulating and recording bot interactions, world complexity, and bot stimuli.</p><p>Quantum computing (which I personally interpret as a major leap in parallel computing) finds application in interacting agents. Agents use randomly generated stimuli from game world (UniProGResS) to interact with each other in a non -deterministic manner</p>
        <p>Nonlinear dynamics OR analog computing is what occurs in biological cells? This may be used for computation.</p>

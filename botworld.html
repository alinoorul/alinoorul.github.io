    <h1>BOTWORLD</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Interactive museum of robots</p><p>Botworld has interactive bots to play around with. Bots built by anyone and everyone are welcome to get human attention here. This museum is open every night and includes rooms inspired from The Shining and Westworld. As people populate botworld with more bots, and as bots start competing for human attention, a society of bots will be born. This society of bots will transform humanity by introducing it to a new species of life. Life that can be engineered at will if humans prefer. Life that can exist for its own sake.</p><p>Botworld displays <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>, moving statues (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatronics'>animatronics</a>).</p><p>This museum has deep ethical dilemmas and would love your input on them:</p><p>1. Matrixims has collections of biological neuronal cells controlling avatars in a video game. Chemicals that form the basis of our emotions are somewhat generated within these cells when they receive input from the game. Are we imprisoning minds with consciousness in a prison cell or are we breathing the ether of an unreal reality into cells?</p><p>2. Matrixims plans to store versions of dead people's minds through <a href='lucidna.html'>Lucidna</a> biobanks. The idea is to capture DNA and cell structures of human brains that were previously alive (mummies like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun'>Tutankhamun</a>, cryopreserved individuals like those in <a href='https://www.alcor.org/'>Alcor</a>'s tanks, humans whose cells have been stored in biobanks), artificially replicate those structures in neural stem cell organoids, and hook them up to a shared version of The Sims. This isn't immortality but it's an interesting experiment if we have wilful consent. Is this right?</p>

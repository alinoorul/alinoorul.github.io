                        <h1>MAN ON THE MOON</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>1 year on the Moon</p><p>This corporation makes the Moon accessible to mankind. It aims to bring (metaphorical) man on the Moon by putting Moonflower on the Moon to prepare it for civilization. Moonflower like the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower'>Mayflower</a>.</p><p>1. Cheap accessible moon travel using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver'>mass driver</a> on Antarctica. Potential sites are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinson_Massif'>Mount Vinson</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Erebus'>Mount Erebus on Ross Island</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_A'>Dome Argus</a>. Mass driver significantly decreases space launch fuel payload to decrease launch costs and increase payload capacity. Exponential growth in space launches expected.</p><p>2. Biology on Moon. A biosphere is necessary to sustain life, grow food and specialized materials, and make the moon habitable for settlers. Companies in The Matrix, <a href='wetwoodhousing.html'>Wetwood Housing</a> and <a href='https://asbldex.github.io'>ASBL</a>, build underlying technology for moon biology applications. ASBL automates biotechnology and Wetwood Housing designs biological self-assembly buildings.</p><p>3. Healthcare on the Moon: <a href='https://onitomed.github.io'>ONITO</a>'s grand vision is healthcare by computers. Human doctors work only when robots, machines and algorithms aren't enough to heal a patient in ONITO. This model of healthcare is being developed for Antarctica, where human doctors are in short supply. Once ONITO healthcare model is perfected in Antarctica, ONITO will provide healthcare on the Moon using computers and human doctors with telehealth.</p><p>4. <a href='https://www.bostonmetal.com/'>Boston Metal</a> steel foundries: Molten Oxide Electrolysis, used in Boston Metal iron ore purification cells, is a low-carbon process to obtain steel. The Moon lacks carbon hence this low-carbon process is necessary to produce steel on the Moon for construction. This idea is directly taken from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@Anthrofuturism'>ANTHROFUTURISM</a> YouTube channel.</p><p>5. Photospacography: A term coined by The Matrix, photospacography is a process where light from manmade satellites etches designs on the surface of a planet. This technology will be used to print architecture in Antarctica's ice sheets. Ice sheets have large planar regions. Designs are etched on planar ice sheets using light-sensitive coating material. Shining space-based light on this material transforms it. This allows printing of designs like roads (2D photospacography) and underground housing (3D photospacography) using differential transformation of ice and material-coated ice.</p><p><a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p>

<h1>GENE2WAVE</h1>
<br>
        <p>Susumu Onho converted genes to music. I’m converting DNA sequences to music to do Fourier transforms </p><p>on them to obtain features that are easily compared. </p><p>I’m converting genetic sequences to waves. Each DNA sequence has a 4 -dimensional wave where each </p><p>dimension represents a base. There is a time -like dimension that is used to denote discrete steps.</p><p>For example, the A wave has a spike wherever we see A in a DNA sequence. Each DNA sequence is thus a </p><p>sum of 4 waves. </p><p>Encoding these waves in such a manner that their frequencies differ from each other (A wave spikes have a </p><p>different frequency than G wave spikes), then taking a Fourier transform of the sum wave (A+G+T+C) might </p><p>make a signature for each DNA sequence.</p><p>This signature MAY allow for alignment -free comparison of DNA sequences. Wave interference and phase -</p><p>shifting play some role as well. I’m researching this.</p>

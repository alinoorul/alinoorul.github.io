    <h1>SIMULATIONS AND LEAKS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A simulation may influence our reality. As explained in Simulacra and Simulation, there isnâ€™t a distinction between the simulation (map) and the Empire. The map, by virtue of its existence in base reality beyond the Empire, frays and its frays remain in base reality. Base reality may be simulated for an AI model. The behavior of that model influences our base reality through information. This information leak means our base reality is not independent of the simulation. It is hyperreal.</p><p>Map apps made us forget directions.</p>

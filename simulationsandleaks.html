<h1>SIMULATIONS AND LEAKS</h1>
<br>
        <p>A simulation may influence our reality.</p><p>As explained in Simulacra and Simulation, there isnâ€™t a distinction between </p><p>the simulation (map) and the Empire. </p><p>The map, by virtue of its existence in base reality beyond the Empire, frays </p><p>and its frays remain in base reality.</p><p>Base reality may be simulated for an AI model. The behavior of that model </p><p>influences our base reality through information.</p><p>This information leak means our base reality is not independent of the </p><p>simulation. It is hyperreal. Map apps made us forget directions.</p>

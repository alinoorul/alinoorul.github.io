<h1>HYPERDEFLATION + 100K</h1>
<br>
        <p>Think of the water cycle.</p><p>Even if you leave all the taps in your house running all day, you will not </p><p>empty the river. No matter how much water you use, it always remains on </p><p>earth. In some form or the other. Essentially, we can use infinite water. </p><p>Because we as humans can only use a finite amount of water at a point in </p><p>time, even if total time is infinite. Because of the cycle.</p><p>Pee gets cycled and comes back in our taps. Water goes nowhere, it just </p><p>takes energy to manipulate it. Thus, water is a perceived infinity. </p><p>All goods can become perceived infinites through extremely efficient </p><p>recycling, infinite energy, free tech, and bots that make bots.</p>

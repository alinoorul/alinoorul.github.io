<h1>π INTRODUCES CURVATURE</h1>
<br>
        <p>A straight line is inherently unequal to the circumference of a circle</p><p>There is something in the curvature of a circle that cannot be flattened. This is termed curvature.</p><p>Pi is irrational because of this curvature. It exists at a fixed point on the number line. We can get </p><p>arbitrarily close to that point, yet we will never reach it. The number exists in nature but cannot be </p><p>found. Because the process of finding it means limiting it to an interval (a straight line) and curvature </p><p>cannot physically be limited to a straight line.</p><p>This is why pi is irrational. Finity  infinity: the duality of uncertainty. The number is finite yet infinite </p><p>uncertainty exists in its position on the number line. This may be proof that pi is normal (of a specific </p><p>kind). Uncertainty is physical.</p>

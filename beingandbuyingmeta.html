    <h1>BEING AND BUYING, META</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Humor aside, I will really need to look into buying Meta.</p><p>Meta’s capabilities of crunching massive amounts of data, for whatever purpose they choose (advertising), is very valuable engineering and social magnetism in one entity. Being accessible in one entity is the value of Meta. Because of one goal, maximizing advertising revenue, they have created tools that are far more valuable than advertising itself. Those capabilities allow creation of a version of a human being in terms of quantifiable data that holds relevance because of other quantifiable data (a human likes something other than another human). It is capturing some form of the essence that makes us human. It is essential in “knowing” who a person is.</p><p>Anyway, onto the revenue streams you’re all hungry for: <a href='sexrobots.html'>sex robots</a> ;)</p>

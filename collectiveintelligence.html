    <h1>COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Collective distributed intelligence needs to be observed through a mathematical model, similar to <a href='https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf'>Bitcoin</a>. Bitcoin is inherently self-correcting which is a robust math model. I believe this math model will be interesting to study collective behavior in ants. A digital twin of an ant colony might be possible with decentralized nodes operating selfishly with inherent (built-in) self correction. Each ant is a decentralized node which acts selfishly. Yet the system of ants survives, like the collective currency Bitcoin</p><p>Bitcoin biology is the study of decentralized systems in biology through blockchain. The inherent randomness inside bitcoinâ€™s structure is the randomness that cells have. Within cells and amongst cells. This randomness can be modeled with complicated quantum chemistry or a random generator.</p><p>Bitcoin is more than a currency. The math model of decentralized intelligence, treating each node as a selfish intelligent being harkens to life and its origins in selfish reproduction.</p><p>The price is Bitcoin will rise and fall but each time it rises, it will rise to dizzyingly new heights because more people will get interested in Bitcoin than lose interest in it. Demand > supply. Each smaller unit will gain more value because Bitcoin is limited. Its price will always increase to higher heights. It is a very powerful mathematical model.</p>

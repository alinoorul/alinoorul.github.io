<h1>COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE</h1>
<br>
        <p>Collective distributed intelligence needs to be observed through a mathematical model, similar to Bitcoin. </p><p>Bitcoin is inherently self -correcting which is a robust math model. I believe this math model will be interesting </p><p>to study collective behavior in ants.</p><p>A digital twin of an ant colony might be possible with decentralized nodes operating selfishly with inherent </p><p>built -in self correction. Each ant is a decentralized node which acts selfishly. Yet the system of ants survives, </p><p>like the collective currency Bitcoin</p><p>Bitcoin biology is the study of decentralized systems in biology through blockchain. The inherent randomness </p><p>inside bitcoinâ€™s structure is the randomness that cells have. Within cells and amongst cells. This randomness </p><p>can be modeled with complicated quantum chemistry or a random generator.</p><p>Bitcoin is more than a currency. The math model of decentralized intelligence, treating each node as a selfish </p><p>intelligent being harkens to life and its origins in selfish reproduction.</p><p>The price is Bitcoin will rise and fall but each time it rises, it will rise to dizzyingly new heights because more </p><p>people will get interested in Bitcoin than lose interest in it. Demand > supply. Each smaller unit will gain </p><p>morevalue because Bitcoin is limited. Its price will always increase to higher heights. It is a very powerful </p><p>mathematical model.</p>

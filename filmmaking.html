    <h1>FILMMAKING</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Matrix has applications in filmmaking. It generates data about interactions that take place between 2 agents, who are based on real humans. This data can be used as fodder to create scripts. Even more awesomely, it can be fed into a pipeline of automated video generation to create entire films. A necessary concept here is unpredictability (non-determinism). This is based on <a href='uniprogress.html'>UniProGResS</a>, the idea that events that take place in the Matrix are ‘unique’. It is achieved by procedurally-generating stimuli using a pseudorandom number generator (O(2^N) algorithm in large-N space)</p>

<h1>FILMMAKING</h1>
<br>
        <p>The Matrix has applications in filmmaking. It generates data about </p><p>interactions that take place between 2 agents, who are based on real </p><p>humans.</p><p>This data can be used as fodder to create scripts. Even more </p><p>awesomely, it can be fed into a pipeline of automated video generation </p><p>to create entire films.</p><p>A necessary concept here is unpredictability (non -determinism). This is </p><p>based on UniProGResS , the idea that events that take place in the </p><p>Matrix are ‘unique’. It is achieved by procedurally -generating stimuli </p><p>using a pseudorandom number generator (O(2^N) algorithm in large -N </p><p>space)</p>

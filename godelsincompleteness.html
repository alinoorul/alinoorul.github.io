    <h1>GODEL'S INCOMPLETENESS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>As we create systems that are designed to be alive, I cannot help but ponder at the role of Godelâ€™s Incompleteness Theorem. These systems will produce statements, which may be individual entities, that are true (exist) but cannot be proven (derived) from the axioms we made.</p><p>In the life I create: digital, biological, or economical, who knows when this incompleteness may strike and leave us struck and possibly stuck?</p>

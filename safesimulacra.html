<h1>SAFE SIMULACRA</h1>
<br>
        <p>In this era of intelligence creating intelligence, safety is paramount.</p><p>I look to solipsism.</p><p>AI systems in a simulated world. Cause and effect occurs there. Simulation </p><p>is indistinguishable from reality for that AI model.</p><p>Reality fed to an AI model doesnâ€™t need to be base reality we humans </p><p>cohabitate. No matter how bad AI gets, a switch that toggles between base </p><p>reality and simulated reality for a robot is a failsafe that cannot fail. </p><p>AI model can plan and plan and plan in its head like a daydreamer.</p>

    <h1>2 MINUTES BEFORE THE BIG BANG</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I hear a rumble across a few million light years. Entanglement news has already told us what the source is. Some kid dropped their pet universe. There was always a non-zero chance of it creating the Bang, but we thought damn it won’t be as bad as Y2K. It’s probably not going to be that bad. Stuff doesn’t just disappear right?</p><p>Sure the coming Bang will destroy everything and create a universe within. But we’ll just be pushed out, so no worries. Probably destroyed to almost non-stuff but still stuff (cuz stuff doesn’t just disappear right?). But we’ll be there, coexisting with this new experiment this shitbag is gonna put us through.</p>

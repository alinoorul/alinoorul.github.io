    <h1>TELEPORTATION WITH PHOTONICS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>My friend in nanophotonics is trying to make computer chips that work with light. Our current chips work with electricity. I feel that the technology he is building will enable a form of teleportation. A lot of math, physics, chemistry, computer science, and biology needs to be done. But I think it is a worthy pursuit.</p><p>I talk of dreams but he knows the science very well . The short-term goal is to show quantum entanglement using photonic chips and he has intriguing ideas, which I will need a few more discussions to understand. But I think a version of teleportation could be possible.</p><p>Current teleportation allows transfer of quantum state instantly to another place (the Moon), but the state in the first place (Earth) will have to be destroyed (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem'>no-cloning theorem</a>). An error-prone copy of a quantum state can be transferred instantly as well (entanglement error). This error-copy of an entangled state might be like a hologram version of us. (Astral project much?). Hence, I think we won't need to be destroyed, and a hologram version of us could be teleported. We will need biology to link it with qualia, i.e. you must experience being the hologram.</p>

<h1>TELEPORTATION WITH PHOTONICS</h1>
<br>
        <p>My friend in nanophotonics is trying to make computer chips that work with light. Our current chips work with </p><p>electricity.</p><p>I feel that the technology he is building will enable a form of teleportation. A lot of math, physics, chemistry, </p><p>computer science, and biology needs to be done. But I think it is a worthy pursuit.</p><p>I talk of dreams but he knows the science very well . The short -term goal is to show quantum entanglement </p><p>using photonic chips and he has intriguing ideas, which I will need a few more discussions to understand.</p><p>But I think a version of teleportation could be possible. Current teleportation allows transfer of quantum state </p><p>instantly to another place (the Moon), but the state in the first place (Earth) will have to be destroyed (no -</p><p>cloning theorem). An error -prone copy of a quantum state can be transferred instantly as well (entanglement </p><p>error). This error -copy of an entangled state might be like a hologram version of us. (Astral project much?). </p><p>Hence, I think we wonâ€™t need to be destroyed, and a hologram version of us could be teleported. We will need </p><p>biology to link it with qualia, i.e.you must experience being the hologram.</p>

    <h1>HOMO DADEM</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Homo dadem: Master of the Universe</p><p>Homo sapiens, all those who choose to do so, become Homo dadem (indestructible, immortal, teleportable, infinite). A new species that bends reality itself to its will. We become god in universes of our own (#theMatrix companies) and parts of the Homo dadem species in our current universe that we shared in 2023 AD. We might someday encounter a species that is to us, what Homo dadem is to future Homo sapiens. That’s cool. See, being Homo dadem is a role. Sometimes you wanna be a master of the universe, sometimes you just wanna be a human being. Lost in living (L.I.L.). We can coexist with other species, even if they are masters of our universe. Hell, if we’re all immortal anyway, we can even go to war with them. It’ll be like a game.</p>

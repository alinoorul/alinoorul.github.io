<h1>CAPITALISM FOR THE 21stCENTURY</h1>
<br>
        <p>Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in the 1700s. Our world has changed. I am creating a new form </p><p>of capitalism: oogonism . (itâ€™s funny) </p><p>I conjecture that while earth may have a shortage of resources for 8 billion humans, the observable </p><p>universe does not. </p><p>An interpretation: there is no point to IP laws. All IP should be free because there is no shortage of IP that </p><p>has potential to save the world. If someone wants to do something with IP , let them do it.</p><p>The 100K plan can help make all IP free. The core concept is we live in a circular world. If you just drink </p><p>water your whole life, you will still not consume the ocean. And because you pee, water goes nowhere. In </p><p>this circle, you have infinite water. Even if life becomes infinite, the amount of water in our use at any </p><p>point in time is finite and cyclic which makes water still effectively infinite. I believe in the universe,</p><p>everything is infinite for us. There is no shortage of anything. Life is not a zero -sum game.</p>

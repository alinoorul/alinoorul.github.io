<h1>SCAMMING IS REDUNDANT</h1>
<br>
        <p>For the amount of time humans spend scamming each other and the pitiful amount of money, it </p><p>is a waste of human effort. If you were to ask rich people to donate their wealth to feed </p><p>scammers, they would gladly do so.</p><p>Many of them would, as seen in The Giving Pledge. </p><p>This is a major foundation for my ‘do good’ philosophy. Rich is a catchall term for people who </p><p>create outsized value, and thus amass large wealth through capitalism. Capitalism works because </p><p>things get better. Things get better because of people who create outsized value, who grow rich. </p><p>Outsized value always happens because our systems get more efficient all the time and we </p><p>harness more resources over time.</p><p>The only update to capitalism that’s needed is the recognition of free distribution of goods and </p><p>services. Some people are better at making money, some people are better are making art. But </p><p>both should have access to all goods and services. That’s the update I’m proposing.</p>

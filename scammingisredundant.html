    <h1>SCAMMING IS REDUNDANT</h1>
    <br>
    <p>For the amount of time humans spend scamming each other and the pitiful amount of money, it is a waste of human effort. If you were to ask rich people to donate their wealth to feed scammers, they would gladly do so. Many of them would, as seen in The Giving Pledge.</p><p>This is a major foundation for my ‘do good’ philosophy. Rich is a catchall term for people who create outsized value, and thus amass large wealth through capitalism. Capitalism works because things get better. Things get better because of people who create outsized value, who grow rich. Outsized value always happens because our systems get more efficient all the time and we harness more resources over time.</p><p>The only update to capitalism that’s needed is the recognition of free distribution of goods and services. Some people are better at making money, some people are better are making art. But both should have access to goods and services. That’s the update I’m proposing.</p>

        <p>SEQUENCED SCENARIOS ( UNIPROGRESS )</p><p>This is a rough idea in my head. Imagine the world we simulate can send stimuli to </p><p>bots to generate conversations (and later on behavior), between bots and between </p><p>the bot and itself. </p><p>Stimuli is based on 2^n states. We use a pseudorandom number generator to label </p><p>states and pick states randomly without traversing the entire state space. </p><p>Certain subsections of this n -bit string are used as stimuli to bots, because bot stimuli </p><p>is a lot smaller.</p><p>Because of the state space being so large, impossible to determine completely in </p><p>finite time, we simulated pseudo -infinity</p><p>Each bot’s behavior is influenced by a random state in this pseudo -infinite space, and </p><p>bots can interact with each other, which can result in unique scenarios occurring in the </p><p>Matrix that are effectively unpredictable, and thus completely new.</p><p>Practically, I intend to do this with procedural -generation algorithms used in games, </p><p>or even simplistic algorithms such as the one in Conway’s Game of Life( CGoL )</p><p>CGoL is a major inspiration. The ability to generate complexity in an unpredictable </p><p>way is a very important idea in giving life to the Matrix.</p>

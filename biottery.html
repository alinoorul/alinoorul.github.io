    <h1>BIOTTERY</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A battery of biology</p><p>I read about voltage present in plant roots. Enough to power a light bulb. Rhizobium bacteria releases 4 electrons converting nitrogen (I think). There are reactions within cells that produce current. A powerful enough reaction designed to be self-sustaining, like photosynthesis, can form the basis of energy storage. This is a battery made of biology, a biottery.</p>

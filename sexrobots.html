<h1>SEX ROBOTS</h1>
<br>
        <p>Anyway, I want to create a bot that performs all the duties of a housekeeper (along with sexual intercourse if the </p><p>owner pleases). A traditional wife, for simplicity. Pays the bills. Cooks hot fresh meals. Cleans the house. Humanoid -</p><p>ishin order to interact with existing systems ( i.e.existing homes, existing lives etc., a bot like that must have hands </p><p>in order to use your plunger to unclog the toilet).</p><p>Biological sex will a test of robustness for the robot. Can the robot be had vigorous sexual intercourse with? If yes, </p><p>then it is fit enough to survive cuts and scratches in the real world. </p><p>This research of mine aims to combine animatronics with the sex toy industry. It will use tech in automata cart (later </p><p>slide) to perform the functions of a housekeeper, i.e.interpreting and paying bills (the systems for which will be </p><p>controlled by other bots that the housekeeper bot can interact with without needing human intervention), ordering </p><p>groceries, cooking with existing utensils, cleaning the house etc. </p><p>Sex is a huge part of these robots. People will buy sex robots even if they don’t perform all the other duties. The </p><p>ability todoother duties can learnt with over -the-air updates. The tech is going to get adoption simply because it </p><p>makes lives easier. It is easier to have a housekeeper that you can have sex with.</p><p>This is why I am researching sex toys right now (don’t picture it :)</p>

    <h1>SEX ROBOTS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I hypothesize sexual intercourse, in the physical manner it is done currently done in humans, is a primal test to determine child-carrying capability of a female by a male, while the entire process of “before sex” is the process to determine child-rearing capability of a male by a female. Here I use male and female by their biological meaning, which is to ask the question: in sexual reproduction, who puts in more effort in the production of a single gamete? The explanation above works because a female invests more into the production of a single gamete, and thus needs to know the male will take care of it. Those that survive are the ones that are taken care of. Genetic code MAY determine how romantic or non-romantic (henceforth referred to as “sappy” for conciseness) two partners are, i.e. how much they care for and love each other. The children that survived and had more children who survived and had more children are the ones that took care of their offspring and partner against nature. Sappiness is a solution to the randomness of genetic code that allows for stable reproduction in the environment. This is a major digression.</p><p>I want to create a bot that performs all the duties of a housekeeper (along with sexual intercourse if the owner pleases). A traditional wife, for simplicity. Pays the bills. Cooks hot fresh meals. Cleans the house. Humanoid-ish in order to interact with existing systems (kitchen, existing lives etc., a bot like that must have hands in order to use your plunger to unclog the toilet).</p><p>Biological sex is a test of robustness for the robot. Can the robot be had vigorous sexual intercourse with? If yes, then it is fit enough to survive cuts and scratches in the real world. This research of mine aims to combine animatronics with the sex toy industry. It uses tech in <a href='automatacart.html'>automata cart</a> and <a href='cnsrobots.html'>CNS robots</a> to perform the functions of a housekeeper, i.e. interpreting and paying bills (the systems for which will be controlled by other bots that the housekeeper bot can interact with without needing human intervention), ordering groceries, cooking with existing utensils, cleaning the house etc.</p><p>Sex is a huge part of these robots. People will buy sex robots even if they don’t perform all the other duties. The ability to do other duties can learnt with over-the-air updates. The tech is going to get adoption simply because it makes lives easier. It is easier to have a housekeeper that you can have sex with. This is why I am researching sex toys right now (don’t picture it ;)</p>

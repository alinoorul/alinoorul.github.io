<h1>STICKY SCIENCE AND THE CREATION OF SCIENCE WITHOUT</h1>
<br>
        <p>HUMANS</p><p>If there is a subject of science in which the number of humans is decreasing, i.e.there is </p><p>content that no one knows about, and the amount of that unknown content is increasing </p><p>(due to human death), then given enough time, there is a high probability of that area of </p><p>science just simply dying out because no one was left who read its books.</p><p>Sticky science are subjects in science that are hot right now. Like machine learning. </p><p>Attracting lots of people in its hallowed halls and etching itself in their memory, and thus </p><p>in the memory of collective science, for a while longer than the rest. </p><p>I would like to create something for science that ensures none of its work is ever </p><p>forgotten. Even a wrong statement has a wealth of information within it, simply by being </p><p>an observation that is incorrect. I need to make bots that understand science, if only by </p><p>capturing papers. Understanding the data (converting it into a useful way) will come soon. </p>

    <h1>ASBL</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Automated Synthetic Biology Lab</p><p>Programmable general-purpose biotech workcell. A biology lab operated by programmers, and later programs. Extensive lab automation powers experiments. Experimental data fed into knowledge stores to design next experiments. The idea is to research and grow everything: clothes, food, houses, engines, consumer tech using biology. Ginkgo Bioworks without the scientists. ASBL is in Antarctica because I am a weird person researching morally questionable things and I canâ€™t jump regulatory hoops.</p><p>Standardized lab automation tools implement research protocols in code. Tools are connected using a central nervous system-like architecture with knowledge base. Simply put, PhD-level scientist bot for biotech. Automated discoveries. ICs became cheap because the processes to manufacture them were automated. Humans designed chips but their production was extensively automated. Biology will become cheap when its processes are automated. Existing lab automation is a start. For bigger scale, the process of designing must be automated. This automation coupled with exponential growth in biology will unlock new heights for humanity. </p><p>ASBL is like ENIAC, a general-purpose programmable biological lab. ASBL is like Intel sprouting from Shockley Semiconductor, but with Ginkgo Bioworks. ASBL is like Microsoft, designing the Windows of biological labs. ASBL is like Apple, democratizing cutting-edge tech to bio labs. ASBL is like ASML, designing the best machines for bio labs. But ASBL is designed to be self-contained. While I want humans to use ASBL, it is designed to be used by robots at scale to find things for us humans. New biomaterials, gene therapies, stem cell techniques, protein imaging techniques, and resolve deep biological questions.</p><p>Projects: Evolving dishbrain into brain-in-a-vat connected through a bio-to-digital interface to a sim in a game of The Sims (see why ASBL is a <a href='thematrixholdings.html'>company in The Matrix</a> ;), ASBL is an intelligent robot controlling biotech lab automation machines to perform experiments in synthetic biology, A self-updating program based on neuronal stem cells performing experiments on stem cell cultures to update its architecture based on results, ASBL machine code is a language that allows experimental protocols to be represented and performed by robots in a standardized manner. This standardized language drives replicable experimentation in ASBL machines worldwide.</p>

    <h1>ASBL</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Automated Synthetic Biology Labs</p><p>ASBL builds robotic labs without human entry for high-throughput lead candidate generation.</p><p>ASBL consults biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in lab automation and machine learning for drug discovery and optimization. We help companies and academic labs establish automation for their manual workflows, use computational biology to find affected metabolic pathways from assay data in bacterial and mammalian cultures, optimize cell lines for bioreactors and make sense of sequencing data; all as an independent contractor.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>Projects in ASBL:</p><p>1. Matrixims: brain organoids (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.09.001'>1</a>) playing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_(video_game)'>The Sims</a></p><p>2. Deconstructed human: organoid (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2459'>2</a>,<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0325-y'>3</a>) bioreactors for testing</p><p>3. Automated E. coli DNA integration (better than <a href='https://www.kytopen.com/products'>Kytopen</a>)</p><p>4. Insulin replacement for type 2 diabetes: our early work using <a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/diabetessubtype'>HumanGEMlib</a> highlighted subtypes of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Each subtype has a unique metabolic signature, in which certain pathways are dysregulated. Our hypothesis based on these data is that each subtype ought to be treated differently, since different reaction pathways are dysregulated in each subtype of T2D.</p><p>5. Lasers from proteins. Reverse photosynthesis is emission of narrow wavelength light from a biological protein like chlorophyll (possibly conjugated with quantum dot).</p><p>6. Cellular agriculture of wasabi and truffles</p><p>7. Lab automation for cultivated meat</p><p>8. Microtubules in carbon nanotube applications</p>

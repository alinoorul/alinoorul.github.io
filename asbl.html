    <p>Automated Synthetic Biology Labs</p><p>Course offering in collaboration with the <a href='https://www.damplab.org/'>DAMP lab at Boston University</a>: ASBL is offering a 2-week hands-on course in lab automation in collaboration with the DAMP lab at Boston University. The course will tentatively run in June 2024. The course is designed for experimental biologists who want to use lab automation to automate their workflows. Multiple workflows like cell culture, plasmid preparation, and sequencing preparation will be demonstrated on <a href='https://opentrons.com/'>Opentrons</a> liquid handling robots. You will have a chance to execute protocols on liquid handlers. The cost for the course is $5000 and sales start in May 2024.</p><p>ASBL is building robotic labs without human entry for high-throughput lead candidate generation.</p>

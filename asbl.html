    <h1>ASBL</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Automated Synthetic Biology Labs</p><p>ASBL builds robotic labs without human entry for high-throughput lead candidate generation.</p><p>ASBL consults companies in lab automation and machine learning for drug discovery and optimization. We establish automation for manual workflows, use computational biology to find affected metabolic pathways from assay data in bacterial and mammalian cultures, optimize cell lines for bioreactors, and make sense of sequencing data; all as a contractor.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>Projects in ASBL:</p><p>1. ASBL Lab 0 ($500,000): this machine feeds bacterial and mammalian cells to keep cells alive. ASBL Lab 0 integrates a liquid handler, plate reader, incubator, refrigerator, cell counter, and robotic arm. Use with Python.</p><p>2. ASBL Lab 1 ($2.5 million): this machine genetically engineers E. coli K12 cells. It adds plasmid transformation capability to ASBL Lab 0. Support equipment also integrated. This machine outputs a genetically engineered bacterial colony given an input plasmid. Use with Python.</p><p>3. ASBL Lab 2 ($100 million): this machine generates therapeutic lead candidates. It can manufacture personalized therapies for patients in clinic. ASBL uses this machine to develop insulin replacements for subtypes of type 2 diabetes. Use with Python.</p><p>4. <a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/diabetessubtype'>HumanGEMlib</a> is a Python library for human genome-scale modeling. <a href='https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM'>HumanGEM</a> (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7331181/'>1</a>) is a systems biology model available online. It contains 12995 reactions in a stochiometric matrix. Using <a href='https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html'>COBRApy</a>, another Python library for flux balance analysis, HumanGEMlib simulates the effects of genetic knockouts on human metabolism reactions using genes identified in type 2 diabetes genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Compared to no-knockout control condition, knockout reaction fluxes differ highlighting the downstream effects of genetic knockouts of genes associated with type 2 diabetes. Subtypes of type 2 diabetes were highlighted from 4-5 signature metabolisms, reported <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/reports/blob/main/diabetes%20systems%20biology.pdf'>here</a>.</p><p>5. Insulin replacement for type 2 diabetes: our early work using <a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/diabetessubtype'>HumanGEMlib</a> highlighted subtypes of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Each subtype has a unique metabolic signature, in which certain pathways are dysregulated. Our hypothesis based on these data is that each subtype ought to be treated differently, since different reaction pathways are dysregulated in each subtype of T2D.</p><p>6. Matrixims: brain organoids (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.09.001'>3</a>) playing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_(video_game)'>The Sims</a></p><p>7.

Automated E. coli DNA integration (better than <a href='https://www.kytopen.com/products'>Kytopen</a>)</p><p>9. Lasers from proteins. Reverse photosynthesis is emission of narrow wavelength light from a biological protein like chlorophyll (possibly conjugated with quantum dot).</p><p>10. Cellular agriculture of wasabi and truffles</p><p>11. Lab automation for cultivated meat</p><p>12. Microtubules in carbon nanotube applications</p><p>ASBL Inc. is incorporated in Delaware, United States and wholly owned by Noorul Ali.</p>

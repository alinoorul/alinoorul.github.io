    <p>Automated Synthetic Biology Labs</p><p>Course offering in collaboration with a Boston-based biotech: ASBL is offering a 2-week hands-on course in lab automation in collaboration with a biotech using lab automation for multiple workflows. The course will tentatively run in June 2024. The course is designed for experimental biologists who want to use lab automation to automate their workflows. Multiple workflows like cell culture, plasmid preparation, and sequencing preparation will be demonstrated on <a href='https://opentrons.com/'>Opentrons</a> liquid handling robots. You will have a chance to execute protocols on liquid handlers. The cost for the course is $5000 and sales start in May 2024.</p><p>ASBL consults biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in lab automation and machine learning for drug discovery and optimization. We help early-stage biotechnology companies and academic labs establish automation for their manual workflows for cheap. We use computational biology to find affected metabolic pathways from assay data in bacterial and mammalian cultures, optimize cell lines for bioreactors, and make sense of sequencing data; all as an independent contractor.</p><p>ASBL is building robotic labs without human entry for high-throughput lead candidate generation.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p>

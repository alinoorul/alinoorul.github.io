    <h1>HYPERDEFLATION + 100K</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This is the near future that I predict and am trying to build. Yes, I am biased. Prices of goods and services become so vanishingly small, that essentially everything is free. Bots make everything (including themselves). They use everything in the Solar System (extensible to the whole Universe) to make stuff for us. They are powered by sunlight (which is free and essentially unlimited). The tech bots use are made by people who opensourced it. They don’t want to make infinite money off their inventions. They know that their inventions’ freeuse will get amazing tech back to them to experience.</p><p>Recycling has become so efficient that mass is basically infinitely recyclable (with infinite energy). Since the amount of stuff we can use in any finite interval of time is finite, this creates an abundance of stuff that is “perceived infinity. All experiences can be had in 100K because everything’s price is vanishingly small. That’s what I’m trying to build. Everyone can buy whatever they want.</p><p>Think of the water cycle. Even if you leave all the taps in your house running all day, you will not empty the river. No matter how much water you use, it always remains on Earth. In some form or the other. Essentially, we can use infinite water. Because we as humans can only use a finite amount of water at a point in time, even if total time is infinite. Because of the cycle, pee gets cycled and comes back in our taps. Water goes nowhere, it just takes energy to manipulate it. Thus, water is a perceived infinity.</p><p>All goods can become perceived infinites through extremely efficient recycling, infinite energy, free tech, and bots that make bots.</p>

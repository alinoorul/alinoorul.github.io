<h1>FINAL NOTES</h1>
<br>
        <p>I have run into the “hard problem of life”. How much time should I </p><p>distribute between presenting my idea to the world, and working on </p><p>my idea?</p><p>I now choose the latter. Here is a message from me in the future: “I </p><p>am currently studying NLP and GANs. I hope 20 pages were enough </p><p>to convince you that The Matrix will quite literally change </p><p>everything.”</p><p>That is future me for present me, who is writing this document. But </p><p>that is present me for you, o reader. Because current me is past me </p><p>in your time.</p>

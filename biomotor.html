    <h1>BIOMOTOR</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Isolated muscular fibers show continuous contracting motion deriving energy from lipids. Can be used to create pressure waves inside cells. This repetitive motion can be used to create an electric motor. I think there is a more direct way to cause ionization and current flow directly from the muscle cells without a magnetic field. </p><p>Biomotor enables us to detect stuff inside cells (conditions that make the muscles move),  consume biomass (lipids) to create motion.</p><p>Massive application for modern liposuction.</p><p>DREAM: I can eat whatever I want and excess food is consumed by these biomotors to keep my physique as I want without the need to workout.</p>

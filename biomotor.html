<h1>BIOMOTOR</h1>
<br>
        <p>Isolated muscular fibers show continuous contracting motion deriving energy from lipids.</p><p>Can be used to create pressure waves inside cells. This repetitive motion can be used to </p><p>create an electric motor. I think there is a more direct way to cause ionization and current flow </p><p>directly from the muscle fibers without a magnetic field. </p><p>Biomotor enables us to detect stuff inside cells (conditions that make the muscles move), </p><p>consume biomass (lipids) to create motion.</p><p>Massive application for modern liposuction. </p><p>DREAM: I can eat whatever I want and excess food is consumed by these biomotors to keep </p><p>my physique as I want without the need to workout. </p>

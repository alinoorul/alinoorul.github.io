    <h1>EARPODS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Earpods are Airpods made of living cells. They donâ€™t need to be taken off. Artificial cells are attached near your eardrum. They exert force using cilia. The force exerted is detected by the eardrum as sound. Cilia produce soundwaves.</p><p>Force exertion using cilia is controlled using a technology I call <a href='redtooth.html'>Redtooth</a>. Similar to Bluetooth, it converts audio waves to signals for cilia to move in specific waves to produce </p><p>sound on the eardrum. Redtooth  is wireless communication with biological cells.</p><p>Earpods are powered by <a href='biomotor.html'>biomotor</a>. Earpods may be built as hearing aids, translators. Cells detect soundwaves of a different language, translate it into your native tongue, and play it on your eardrum. You hear in your native tongue what someone says in theirs.</p>

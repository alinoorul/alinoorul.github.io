    <h1>DIGITAL AND BIOLOGICAL LIFE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>An artificial CNS in a digital environment is a key to equate digital and biological life. Biological life produces neuronal currents that are detected digitally. These neuronal inputs produce action in a simulated world. This action may be simulated by entirely digital programs. Is this digital life? Digital life in its own digital world. Solipsism may cause it to have consciousness.</p><p>Silicon-based life is not far. The very mechanisms through which living beings work, the specific kinds of chemistry that lead to life, this replicated in silicon. Silicon with enough variety in doping gives unique characteristics. A combination of different kinds of Si connected together in a complex web of interactions is akin to a living cell. With control mechanisms, DNA, proteins. In a book Emergent Computation, they talk about computability of DNA. Computation that we do in silicon is equivalent to what happens in cells | cells can be replicated digitally.</p>

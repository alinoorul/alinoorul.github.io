<h1>BASE 1 LIFE</h1>
<br>
        <p>Our DNA consists of A,C,T, and G. These bases define us. I call it base 0 </p><p>life.</p><p>When we create synthetic life, we should explore giving their DNA different </p><p>bases. Even if these organisms evolve to become harmful, they canâ€™t </p><p>interact with human DNA. This idea has been explored before.</p><p>This separation might be necessary for biosecurity. ASBL will experiment </p><p>with rampant artificially sped up evolution and dangerous organisms are </p><p>bound to emerge.</p><p>We need to ensure they are incompatible with human beings. Base 1 life.</p>

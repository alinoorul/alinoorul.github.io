    <h1>MIND RESEARCH WITH PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I call it mind research but it is more mind control</p><p>Psychoactive substances change the way a person’s neurons light up on stimuli. All marijuana plants have similar genetic code. Within genetic code of marijuana hides another code: the change that a specific strain of marijuana brings about in a person’s neurons. We can characterize these codes and their subsequent effects on human neurons, to create models to explain this behavior. These models show insight into the working of the brain. This is simply done by inducing effects into a brain and characterizing it with a cause we know of, from a known strain of a psychoactive substance. As in science, we will link a known cause with an observed effect, to help us characterize the system of cause and effect, which in our case is the brain. We then make models of this to explain the effect, based on the cause and effect we observe.</p><p>This is coming dangerously close to being a digression, so let me conclude by saying psychoactive substances are important to mind research, simply because of generating perturbations in an opaque system (our brain). We can characterize the functions of the brain because we can study these perturbations in a known system (genetic code of psychoactive plants).</p>

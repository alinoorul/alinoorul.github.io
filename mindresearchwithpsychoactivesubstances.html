<h1>MIND RESEARCH WITH PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES</h1>
<br>
        <p>I call it mind research but it is more mind control</p><p>Psychoactive substances change the way a person’s neurons light up on stimuli. All marijuana plants have </p><p>similar genetic code. Within genetic code of marijuana hides another code: the change that a specific code of </p><p>marijuana brings about in a person’s neurons</p><p>We can research about these codes and their subsequent effects on human neurons, and we can create </p><p>models to explain this behavior. These models will show insight into the working of the brain. This is simply </p><p>done by inducing effects into a brain and characterizing it with a cause we know of, from a known strain of a </p><p>psychoactive substance. As in science, we will link a known cause with an observed effect, to help us </p><p>characterize the system of cause and effect, which in our case is the brain. We then make models of this cause </p><p>to explain the effect, based on the cause and effect we observe.</p><p>This is coming dangerously close to being a digression, so let me conclude by saying psychoactive substances </p><p>are important to mind research, simply because of generating perturbations in an opaque system (our brain). </p><p>We can characterize the functions of the brain because we can study these perturbations in a known system </p><p>(genetic code of psychoactive plants). </p>

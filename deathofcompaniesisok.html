<h1>DEATH OF COMPANIES IS OK</h1>
<br>
        <p>Lazrlake, which I described on the page before, is a startup designed to solve the </p><p>homeownership problem. Let’s say it does, in 30 years.</p><p>After 30 years, let’s say there isn’t a homeownership crisis. People own homes. They share, barter </p><p>homes. They’ve come up with their own transactions without the need for Lazrlake as an </p><p>intermediary. </p><p>Lazrlake works because of a constantly increasing number of signups. That allows us to buy more </p><p>homes and we give up less homes than we buy; soour portfolio value always goes up. It always </p><p>goes up because we assume land on Earth is limited and will always retain value.</p><p>This assumption falls flat in many cases: Earth has more people moving out than being born, </p><p>people share homes without the need of monetary comparison. There are lots of ways by which </p><p>Lazrlake the company becomes redundant. This is fine. Hopefully the company solves the </p><p>problem it set out to solve before it dies. The death of a company is okay.</p>

<h1>CNS ROBOTS</h1>
<br>
        <p>Robots with a central nervous system. </p><p>Robots have limbs, wheels, and actuators. These devices run on numbers. </p><p>A sequence of bits programs a motor to spin at some frequency, and limbs </p><p>to have a specific configuration. This is very similar to how human limbs </p><p>work. Electric and chemical signals cause limbs to behave in a certain way. </p><p>There is information equivalence between the two. CNS robots will have no </p><p>firmware, driver, or compiler layers. Layers of abstraction from electric </p><p>currents (bits) to Python programs were designed for human beings </p><p>because we cannot think in bits. Neural networks donâ€™t have this limitation. </p><p>They can think in numbers (artificial) or electrical and chemical signals </p><p>(biological). A neural network can thus learn behavior without needing </p><p>explicit programming. This is the next step in robotics. CNS robots that learn </p><p>behavior through numbers or information. Like how a human baby learns.</p>

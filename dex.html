    <h1>DEX</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Matrix was a set of decks. That is because the version of me that has time to do stuff for The Matrix is someone who can write decks/dex and program. I don’t have the bandwidth to make websites, apps, movies, paintings, books, and other forms of content.</p><p>But ‘bots that make bots’ will have website-maker bots, app-maker bots, painter-bots, and writer-bots. They  take my Dex as input and create versions of it (books, movies, website, research papers). These would be products that mindkind can consume. There are too many for me to make manually.</p><p>So what I am making right now is an <a href='intelligentdataparser.html'>intelligent data parser</a>.</p><p>The goal is to make is a ‘programmer-bot’. A bot that can take in my Dex and build the futuristic stuff I write about by manipulating human-designed systems, like photolithography machines or Ginkgo’s bioworks. Stuff that humans currently use to make futuristic technology, used by bots. The reasons to use these machines, the experiments, also designed by bots. The results interpreted, understood, added to collective knowledge of science, and reintegrated into new experiments, all by bots.</p><p>Science done by bots. PhD-level scientist bots. That’s also why I write the Dex. It is content for bots to use.</p>

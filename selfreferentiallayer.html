<h1>SELF -REFERENTIAL LAYER</h1>
<br>
        <p>A corpus of questions asked of a bot and answers generated by the bot serves as an </p><p>approximation of memory. By labeling the corpus differently from the rest, I want to </p><p>bootstrap the concept of self in the bot.</p><p>I believe this will help in bootstrapping consciousness in bots. Using this corpus to </p><p>retrain is not useful because answers in this corpus are exactly what the agent </p><p>generates. But this corpus is useful in 2 contexts I can think of: differentiating the self </p><p>from others through communication corpuses and maintaining a memory of self. </p><p>Si <-f(Si-1, Si)</p><p>i.e.subsequent state depends on previous state and another factor (possibly the next </p><p>state itself). I am yet to explore this idea fully, but I believe Conwayâ€™s Game of Life </p><p>will hold importance in its exploration. </p><p>This is also the description of a non -deterministic state machine.  </p>

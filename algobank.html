                        <p>Insured algorithms</p><p>Algobank is Algorithm Bank, a set of continuously updated algorithms verified and insured by Algobank Inc. These algorithms can be embedded into other programs. Algobank insures against hacking.</p><p>Continuous updates and verification make Algobank a store of fast and secure algorithms. Embed these into your programs.</p><p>Algobank brings royalties to the world of opensource code. If music and digital art can be monetized in the favor of artists, so can code. 33% of the insurance fee is paid to the programmers who built the current iteration of the algorithm. Since algorithms are continuously updated, programmers compete for payouts with faster and more secure algorithms.</p><p>Algobank insures its algorithms. If your software suffers a security breach or hack due to Algobank code, Algobank will pay for damages. In exchange, we charge an insurance fee to maintain algorithm integrity.</p><p>Algobank is managed by opensourced algorithms. Payout percentages, insurance payout policies, and prices of algorithms per compute cycle are being formulated and will be completely public.</p>

            1. If banks directly or indirectly own residential property, they are incentivized to rent instead of mortgage. Rent is essentially free money whereas mortgage requires the bank to give out a large chunk of money today for monthly payments later. Even if we assume banks don't directly own residential property (though JP Morgan Chase and others may very well do so), they loan to large residential landlords. These loans are large, offsetting marginally lower interest rates. Plus, business loan interest rates are generally higher. Banks are thus incentivized to reject mortgage applications in favor of renters. This is why we have people paying $950 in rent, rejected from $800 per month mortgage payments. Incentives are sorely misaligned toward tenancy not homeownership.

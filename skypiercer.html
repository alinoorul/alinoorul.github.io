                        <p>Boston office</p><p>Skypiercer is The Matrix's planned office in Boston, USA. It is going to be the tallest building in Boston. This is relatively low-hanging fruit at 242 feet, with a budget $1 billion (2024).</p><p>Each floor in Skypiercer is the office of a <a href='index.html'>company in The Matrix</a>. An ecosystem of companies share intelligence, labor and machines to achieve their goals. Skypiercer's penthouse hosts parties every weekend for interaction among companies because The Matrix bets on the network effect of the smartest people in the world being in the same club.</p><p>The name skypiercer stems from a long-term vision of building space elevators in this skyscraper. In the top floor of skypiercers, a jump will take you to space to experience weightlessness.</p>

        <p>Many many AI models. Gotta characterize emall.</p><p>Need a primary key for each AI model. A function of model weights and architecture. </p><p>Weights + architecture to replicate model. Compressed representation of each model.</p><p>What is the best compressed representation of a model architecture? DNA. This gene code </p><p>allows organisms to be created in the physical world. It is mechanism in code. The </p><p>mechanism is defined by chemistry itself.</p><p>We need a sort of DNA for programs. Something that can replicate AI models like ChatGPT , </p><p>Xenobots , GPT -4, Stable Diffusion etc. A document to replicate AI models that we donâ€™t fully </p><p>interpret and understand but can still replicate. This document is program DNA. </p>

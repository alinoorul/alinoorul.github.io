<h1>EARPODS FOR TRANSLATION</h1>
<br>
        <p>Earpods  are Airpods  made of living cells. They donâ€™t need to be taken off. </p><p>Artificial cells are attached near your eardrum. They exert force using cilia. The force </p><p>exerted is detected by the eardrum as sound. Cilia produce soundwaves.</p><p>Force exertion using cilia is controlled using a technology I call Redtooth . Similar to </p><p>Bluetooth, it converts audio waves to signals for cilia to move in specific waves to produce </p><p>sound on the eardrum. Redtooth  is wireless communication with biological cells.</p><p>Earpods  are powered by biomotor . Earpods  may be built as hearing aids, translators. Cells </p><p>detect soundwaves of a different language, translate it into your native tongue, and play it </p><p>on your eardrum. You hear in your native tongue what someone says in theirs.</p>

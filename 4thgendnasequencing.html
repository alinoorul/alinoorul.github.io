    <h1>4TH GEN DNA SEQUENCING</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Sequence DNA with one hair, one drop of blood, one drop of sperm, one cell etc. Sequence entire 3 billion base pairs by using the biological mechanism that replicates DNA, i.e. polymerase and associated machinery that happens in cells. Recreate this molecular mechanism in a tiny machine that takes in above kind of sample. For each base, let it the device emit a signal (preferably electronic, i.e. high frequency) that is detected. Basically Oxford nanopore tech on a molecular scale. A kind of Oxford nanopore exists in our bodies anyway. DNA polymerase + luciferase to emit base-specific wavelength.</p><p>Lucidna is building 4th gen DNA sequencing and doing a DNA based census of humanity. Engineering 2 proteins (polymerase and luciferase, or potentially quantum dots) to work together in a pathway to detect nucleotide and generate narrow wavelength light/electric current. Polymerase acts as nanopore  and luciferase acts as signaling mechanism.</p><p>DNA-based humanity census is the future of identity replacing visas, passports, and social security numbers</p>

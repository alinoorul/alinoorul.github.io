    <h1>4TH GEN DNA SEQUENCING</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Sequence DNA with one hair, one drop of blood, one drop of sperm, one cell etc. Sequence entire 3 billion base pairs by using the biological mechanism that replicates DNA, i.e. polymerase and associated machinery that happens in cells. Recreate this molecular mechanism in a tiny machine that takes in above kind of sample. For each base, let it the device emit a signal (preferably electronic, i.e. high frequency) that is detected. Basically Oxford nanopore tech on a molecular scale. A kind of Oxford nanopore exists in our bodies anyway. DNA polymerase + luciferase to emit base-specific wavelength.</p>

    <h1>100K PLAN</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I am building a new economic model. Every human being on Earth gets $100k a year. What will they do with this $100k a year?</p><p>Total GDP of the world needs to be at least 800 trillion USD. Imagine all this money is used to buy bread, that costs $2.49/loaf. Hence, the total amount of bread needed in this world is 320 trillion loaves. It is the maximal amount (maximal economics). The whole world doesnâ€™t eat bread. But a lot of the world eats wheat.  We need the wheat equivalent of 320T loaves of bread ~ the maximal amount of wheat. How do we make this much wheat? Cost price analysis for all items in the consumer price index to create goals for the amount of stuff we need to produce to fulfill maximal (simulated infinity) needs. Then I will create a circular economy model to simulate infinite stuff for all of us.</p><p>100K a year is given to everyone in the world for the license to use any IP they create. At a personal level, all that a person does is IP. The Matrix wants to give every person in the world 100k USD. For that, they share their IP. They also gain access to all IP created by those paid 100k, (those in The Matrix). A world without patents and copyrights. There is a database that proves ownership but open access everything. All content is freely available, there are no paywalls or adverts in anything. It is basically catalog purchase for every person in the world. The Matrix will use the stuff a person does to create bots of the person, that perform productive labor of that person, while the person does whatever they want.</p>

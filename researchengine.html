    <h1>RESEARCH ENGINE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Get a dex</p><p>Get your dex <a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/devpy'>here</a>. Python required.</p><p>A dex is an Internet journal to put your research papers on the Internet. Think self-hosted arXiv. Put PDFs of your research papers in a folder. A Python script, dev.py, makes a website from PDFs. You need to know some Python to change website properties.</p><p>Run dev.py once. Put PDFs in raw folder. Run dev.py twice. Index.html in the dex folder is your website.</p><p>Put this website on GitHub Pages. You have a text-only collection of pages. Each page is your research paper.</p><p>This is your own journal freely available on the Internet.</p><p>Put out truth because credibility lost is not won back.</p><p>Research Engine is a peer-reviewed journal and social network to connect academia. We are adding peer review to dexs. This platform requires verified .edu emails to register.</p><p>Email the founder at <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Next steps:</p><p>1. Make dev.py into a Python library webdex <br>2. Implement GitHub Pages and self hosting into webdex library <br>3. DNS-like library (dexlib) for global self-hosted dexs <br>4. Peer review functionality using dex library dexlib <br>5. Mobile app to read dexs obtained from dexlib</p><p>This website is a dex. It is built using <a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/devpy'>devpy</a>. Current workflow of this website's maintainer comprises of editing data.json, running dev.py to get updated website and adding updated HTML files to the <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/alinoorul.github.io'>project on GitHub Pages</a>. This page is in the hyperlinked project above. The homepage of this website is hyperlinked to Index.html or <a href='https://alinoorul.github.io'>https://alinoorul.github.io</a>, a free URL thanks to <a href='https://www.github.com'>GitHub</a>. You can host on GitHub Pages or ideally self-host.</p>

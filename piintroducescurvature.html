<h1>PI INTRODUCES CURVATURE</h1>
<br>
        <p>A straight line is inherently unequal to the circumference of a circle</p><p>There is something in the curvature of a circle that cannot be flattened. This is termed curvature. Pi is irrational because of this curvature. It exists at a fixed point on the number line. We can get arbitrarily close to that point, yet we will never reach it. The number exists in nature but cannot be found. Because the process of finding it means limiting it to an interval (a straight line) and curvature cannot physically be limited to a straight line. This is why pi is irrational. Finity  infinity: the duality of uncertainty. The number is finite yet infinite uncertainty exists in its position on the number line. This may be proof that pi is normal (of a specific kind).</p><p>Uncertainty is physical.</p>

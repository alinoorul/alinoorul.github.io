    <h1>ARCTIC</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Arctic region is very valuable in climate change. In Boston, there were barely any winters in 2022. Snowed 4 days over 5 months of winter. Climate change is real. Cold places are becoming hotter (habitable). The best temperature for human productivity is 15-25C. </p><p>A new world map needs to be made. Arctic ocean at the center, Alaska, North America, and upper South America to the left. Russia, Europe, and upper Asia on the right. On the flip side (not bottom), Antarctica at the center, lower South America, lower Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p><p>Antarctica is massive (it is a continent). New landmasses. Global migration. A new world poised to survive climate change. We need to connect both very well lest Homo sapiens VS. Neanderthals II happens.</p>

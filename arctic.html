<h1>ARCTIC</h1>
<br>
        <p>Very valuable in climate change</p><p>In Boston there were barely any winters this year. Snowed 4 days over 5 months of winter. </p><p>Climate change is real.</p><p>Cold places are becoming hotter (habitable). The best temperature for human productivity is </p><p>15-25C. </p><p>A new world map needs to be made. Arctic ocean at the center, Alaska, North America, and </p><p>upper South America to the left. Russia, Europe, and upper Asia on the right. On the flip side </p><p>(not bottom), Antarctica at the center, lower South America, lower Asia, Africa, and Australia. </p><p>Antarctica is much bigger (it is a continent).</p><p>New landmasses. Global migration. A new world poised to survive climate change. We need to </p><p>connect both very well lest Homo sapiens VS. Neanderthals II happens.</p>

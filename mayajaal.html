India, Pakistan, China, and Kashmiris have still not resolved the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict'>territorial dispute over Kashmir</a>. These sides of the story must be heard: Kashmiris' right to choose, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus'>Kashmiri Pandit exodus</a> changing Kashmir's demographics, Pakistan's claim according to religious demographics in 1947, and Chinese control of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksai_Chin'>Aksai Chin</a>. A referendum (plebiscite) is pending since 1947 and must be conducted. India fears this referendum because Kashmiri Pandits may not get votes though they are rightful residents of the regions, and the Muslim demographic may side with Pakistan's claim over the region. This fear is rational. Mayajaal Party does not want to give up Kashmir. Voting is necessary for lasting peace in Kashmir. Mayajaal Party will campaign in Kashmir to convince Kashmiris to side with India. India is successful, secular and safe. Pakistan is none of the three and cannot afford to develop Kashmir. Mayajaal Party is prepared to make concessions to Kashmir like autonomy in state governance and no income tax. Mayajaal Party plans to achieve lasting peace in this region. We make no guarantees to secure all of Kashmir (including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin) for India. The referendum will collect data for Mayajaal Party on Kashmiri choice to better inform India's Kashmir strategy. The eventual goal is to enforce the will of the Kashmiri people after convincing Kashmir's residents to choose to be part of India. With India, a bright future awaits. Alternatives are Kashmiri independence which requires trade with India for all material goods, or Pakistani Kashmir which is infeasible due to Pakistan's debt-ridden failed economy. India is Kashmir's best bet.</p><p>Referendum has 3 choices: India, Pakistan, Azad Kashmir. District-wise voting will be done. Mayajaal Party will discuss and decide what to do with districts voting for Pakistan or Azad Kashmir. This referendum is primarily for Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, and Aksai Chin regions. India will retain sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh regions regardless of referendum votes of these 2 regions. This referendum guarantees representation of Kashmiri residents and descendants of 1947 Kashmiris. Mayajaal Party makes no guarantees to enforce results of the referendum across the region because multiple parties are involved who must agree to a diplomatic resolution. Rest assured, Kashmiri choice will influence Mayajaal Party policy on Kashmir in favor of Kashmiris.</p><p><a href='#about' id='about'>About Mayajaal Party</a><br><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)'>Maya</a> is a Sanskrit word meaning illusions humans create for themselves; belief in illusions birthed by our minds gives them meaning. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)'>Ma-ya</a> literally translates to 'not there, yet there'. Mayajaal Party (Matrix Party in English) is named after the idea that government exists on people's belief. As long as people believe in their government, government exists. When people's faith in their government is broken, government ceases to hold power. Government is an illusion of the people, by the people, for the people. Mayajaal is remembrance of the sombre fact that the Government of India exists only as long as Indian citizens believe in it.</p><p>Mayajaal is web of illusions. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)'>Maya</a> is a deep concept explored in <br>1. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas'>Vedas</a>: 'The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion (maya) of the Asura'<br>2. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads'>Upanishads</a>: 'Then it is all mere Maya, with which the Brahman (Supreme Soul) deceives himself'<br>3. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran'>Quran</a>: 'The life of this world is nothing but an illusion of enjoyment'</p><p>'The Universe an illusion' is an idea in Hinduism and Islam. Mayajaal in Mayajaal Party is the vision we created to serve the people of India. This vision exists only as long as people have faith in it and believe. Members of Mayajaal Party must remember this at all times.</p><p><a href='#manifesto'>Mayajaal Manifesto 2025</a> was created by Noorul Ali and Rajat Pachauri.</p>

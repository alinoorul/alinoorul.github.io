    <h1>LIST OF LISTS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>•It’s less to do with lists, and more to do with lists of lists. A list contains things. It can contain n things within, that can be m different things. One can focus on each one of these things sequentially, in the “list” structure. Why do presentations work so much with lists? Cuz a presentation of 10 slides can be distilled into 1 slide (using the question asked to determine inclusion). This 1 slide contains some information of each slide, this list is of subsequent items, lists of greater detail into each item. A kind of lossy compression that saves time.</p><p>Each bullet point is integral to the question asked that leads to the formation of a list</p>

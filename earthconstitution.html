    <h1>EARTH CONSTITUTION</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Inspired from the Outer Space Treaty and Antarctic Treaty System, we need an Earth Constitution that nations agree with to protect and nurture human life.</p><p>On Antarctica and the ISS, there is relatively less conflict amongst natives of different lands. On average, they have a relatively less chance of fighting with each other with the intention to kill (war). This means humans have a chance at living with each other peacefully. That is what the Earth Constitution is designed for. Peaceful coexistence. Major goals for the Earth Constitution include making homeownership a basic right, a centralized passport to denote Earth citizenship, globally centralized basic food, healthcare and education for free. No one starves, is homeless, lacks healthcare or education.</p>

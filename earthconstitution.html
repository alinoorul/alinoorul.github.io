<h1>EARTH CONSTITUTION</h1>
<br>
        <p>Inspired from the Outer Space Treaty and Antarctic Treaty System, we need an Earth </p><p>Constitution that nations agree with to protect and nurture human life.</p><p>On Antarctica and the ISS, there is relatively less conflict amongst natives of </p><p>different lands. On average, they have a relatively less chance of fighting with each </p><p>other with the intention to kill (war). This means humans have a chance at living </p><p>with each other peacefully.</p><p>That is what the Earth Constitution is designed for. Peaceful coexistence. Major </p><p>goals for the Earth Constitution include making homeownership a basic right, a </p><p>centralized passport to denote Earth citizenship, globally centralized basic food, </p><p>healthcare and education for free. No one starves, is homeless, lacks healthcare or </p><p>education.</p>

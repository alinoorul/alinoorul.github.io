<h1>Homo dadem (MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE)</h1>
<br>
        <p>Homo sapiens, all those who choose to do so, become Homo dadem (i.i.t.i .)</p><p>A new species that bends reality itself to its will. </p><p>We become god in universes of our own ( #theMatrix companies) and parts of the </p><p>Homo dadem species in our current universe that we shared in 2023 AD.</p><p>We might someday encounter a species that is to us, what Homo dadem is to future </p><p>Homo sapiens. That’s cool. See, being Homo dadem is a role. Sometimes you wanna</p><p>be a master of the universe, sometimes you just wanna be a human being. Lost in </p><p>living (L.I.L.). We can coexist with other species, even if they are masters of our </p><p>universe. Hell, if we’re all immortal anyway, we can even go to war with them. It’ll be </p><p>like a game.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Party like it's 2100</p><p>Party City is a planned city in New England to cater to night owls, because the City of Boston don't let us party after 2AM. Adult theme park open Thu-Sun!</p><p>Party City is an ode to The Great Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is royalty that birthed itself; he made himself a nobleman. American nobility are humans who create great selves from thin air. Party City salutes The Great Gatsby every time we open to party, all weekend every weekend.</p><p><a href='#botworld'>Botworld</a><br><a href='#club0g'>Club 0G</a><br><a href='#location'>Location</a><br><a href='#partybnb'>PartyBNB</a><br><a href='#partytrain'>Party Train</a><br><a href='#tickets'>Tickets</a><br><a href='#whatsopen'>What's Open</a><br><a href='#contact'>Contact</a></p><p><a href='#botworld' id='botworld'>Botworld</a></p><p>Botworld is an interactive museum of robots</p><p>Botworld has interactive bots to play around with. Bots built by anyone and everyone are welcome to get human attention here. This museum is open every night and includes rooms inspired by The Shining and Westworld. As people populate botworld with more bots, and as bots start competing for human attention, a society of bots is born. This society of bots transforms humanity by introducing it to a new species of life. Life, engineered at will as humans prefer. Life, existing for its own sake.</p><p>Botworld displays <a href='https://asbldex.github.io/matrixims.html'>Matrixims by ASBL</a>, moving statues (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatronics'>animatronics</a>), programmable Unitree G1 and more.</p><p>This museum needs your input on deep ethical dilemmas:</p><p>1. Matrixims has collections of biological neuronal cells controlling avatars in a video game. Chemicals forming the basis of our emotions are created within these cells when they receive input from the game. Are we imprisoning minds with consciousness in a prison cell or are we breathing the ether of an unreal reality into cells?</p><p>2. Matrixims plans to store versions of dead people's minds through <a href='lucidna.html'>Lucidna</a> biobanks, saving DNA and cells of human brains that were previously alive (mummies like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun'>Tutankhamun</a>, cryopreserved individuals like those in <a href='https://www.alcor.org/'>Alcor</a>'s tanks, humans whose cells have been stored in biobanks). Artificial replication of neural structures of human brains in neural organoids and connecting them to a shared version of The Sims video game is Matrixims by ASBL. This isn't immortality but an interesting experiment, with wilful consent. Is this right?<br><br></p><p><a href='#club0g' id='club0g'>Club 0G</a></p><p>Club 0G is a zero gravity nightclub in Party City. Give us ideas how to build it.

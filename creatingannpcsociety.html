<h1>CREATING AN NPC SOCIETY</h1>
<br>
        <p>I want to test the effects of communication between equivalent NLP models (agents).</p><p>My strategy: </p><p>1. Conversations between 2 agents are seeded with different inputs and recorded</p><p>2. Conversational data is used for retraining agent is differentiated </p><p>from client training data with a unique label and different weight</p><p>I don’t have any specific reasons to do this. I just want to study the </p><p>importance of communication and simulate the emergence of language. I </p><p>feel it’ll hold a lot of insight.</p>

    <p>If you think of religion, corporations, and empires in the same context of dealing with people, what has survived the longest is religion. This is because at its core, religion is for the collective benefit of followers. There are rules but at their cores, all religions are basically guidelines for humans to act in society. Rules given by game theory scientists wherein if people all act in a certain manner, it will be in everyoneâ€™s collective benefit.</p><p>Collective benefit lasts because it is just there, with free and equitable access for all: church, Wikipedia.</p>

    <h1>ONITO</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Medical data infrastructure</p><p>ONITO is a medical data layer to maintain privacy of medical data using secure multiparty computation. ONITO works using STDinfo, a paradigm to make medical inferences without exchanging medical data.</p><p>STDinfo is a program that allows 2 users to ascertain if they can engage in safe sex based on their sexually transmitted disease (STD) reports, while keeping medical data private from each other, ONITO, and other 3rd parties. STDinfo converts an STD panel report into a bit string, locally on a user's device. This bit string is private and only visible to the owner of the medical report. Bitwise XOR is performed using secure multiparty computation on 2 strings from 2 users who have matched on a dating app and wish to check if they can engage in safe sex. Using secure multiparty computation currently powered by <a href='https://mpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>MPyC</a>, a function can be operated on private data from 2 users without sharing. This allows users to locally compute bitwise XOR on their devices, without sharing data with each other, ONITO, or dating apps. A yes is given if both users test negative for all STDs, or test positive on the same STDs, otherwise a no is given. Currently, the STD panel consists of chlamydia, HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.</p><p>STDinfo also verifies data integrity using trusted diagnostic labs. To ensure reports are not tampered by users, encrypted version STD panel reports are sent from both the trusted lab where a user got tested, and the user. This encrypted form is the digital signature of the report and it allows ONITO to verify that the lab's report, and not a tampered version, is being used. Encryption ensures no medical data is read by ONITO and both reports (lab and user) are the same.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo GitHub repository</a></p>

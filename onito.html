    <h1>ONITO</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Reinvent healthcare</p><p>ONITO is in deep thought on how to reinvent healthcare for better patient outcomes. The need of the hour is a mathematical model that insures the duration of human life. ONITO experimented with machine learning-assisted doctors and privacy-preserving healthcare analysis. We had a dream of bot doctors to alleviate the global shortage of doctors. We're experimenting with projects to chart a viable path toward that vision. We may never get there, because human life may be fundamentally unquantifiable. Healing a human may just need the human touch. Still, we strive.</p><p>Hire our next experiment. For $100,000/year, we will help you avoid <a href='https://www.oregon.gov/omb/topics-of-interest/pages/optum-change-healthcare-data-breach.aspx'>Optum's fate</a> by implementing STDinfo in your EHR.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>ONITO builds medical data infrastructure to help doctors. Our web application implements a view for predictive modeling of COVID-19 lung damage, pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmia. We implemented <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo</a> to maintain privacy of medical data. STDinfo is a Python script using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation'>secure multiparty computation</a>. ONITO uses <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo</a> to make medical inferences without exchanging medical data, currently limited to checking whether 2 individuals are sexually compatible using their sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) medical test reports. Reports are not shared between parties nor with ONITO due to STDinfo.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo</a> converts an STD panel report into a bit string, locally on a user's device. This bit string is private and only visible to the owner of the medical report. Bitwise XOR is performed using secure multiparty computation on 2 strings from 2 users, who may match on a dating app and wish to check if they can engage in safe sex. Using secure multiparty computation using a Python package, <a href='https://mpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>MPyC</a>, a function is operated on private data from 2 users without sharing. This allows users to locally compute bitwise XOR on their devices, without unencrypted sharing data with each other, ONITO, or dating apps. A yes is given if both users test negative for all STDs, or test positive on the same STDs, otherwise a no is given. Currently, the STD panel on which STDinfo is built consists of chlamydia, HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.</p><p>Data need to be verified for integrity, since in STDinfo version 1, a user may input incorrect panel reports as bit strings. This is a major flaw which can be overcome with trusted diagnostic labs. STDinfo version 2 must ensure reports are not tampered by users. Encrypted STD panel reports are sent from both a trusted lab where a user got tested, and the user. This encrypted form is a digital signature of the report and it allows ONITO to verify the authenticity of the input report. If both encrypted reports from the lab and the user match, it is verified that the report is not tampered and can be used in STDinfo. Encryption ensures no medical data is read by ONITO and both reports (lab and user) are the same. This is a planned update based on simple <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography'>public key cryptography</a> and digital signatures.</p><p>No unencrypted patient data with ONITO. Only on patient devices. Doctors allowed access by patients through ONITO (web, app, mobile, desktop). ONITO transfers encrypted data from patients to doctors. Doctors and patients share a code that ONITO doesn't know using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange'>Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a> to encrypt communication between the patient and the doctor. Once the doctor has been issued a key by the patient, the doctor receives encrypted medical data from the patient transferred through the ONITO application on patient and doctor devices. These data are decrypted using the shared key, which ONITO doesn't know. These patient data are further fed into a pipeline of machine learning models to give disease predictions to the doctor. A view of the machine learning pipeline with a backend capable of storing electronic health records was previously built by ONITO. It needs to be updated. Previously, we used MEAN stack. We now use Python for everything.</p><p>ONITO products are not approved by the FDA for use in hospitals and diagnostic labs in the US.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo GitHub repository</a></p><p>Much is left to be done. We're hiring for equity (equal split). Funds currently limited. Email me what you can do.</p>

<h1>LATER ON, INTELLIGENT BEING</h1>
<br>
        <p>We’ll create bots that aren’t deterministic (have free will, free thought, free speech, emotions -> </p><p>self -preservation ), have the stuff that makes us human. The humane. </p><p>They might have societies; they might have love. We don’t want to control them. They’re alive like us. They have qualia. </p><p>They know they have qualia. They can feel. They deserve the same rights as us. When we can create bots like that, </p><p>those that pass the Noorul Test (where a bot is so alive that we are empathetic to it), that’s when we realize we’ve </p><p>created life.</p><p>These aren’t machines. They are as human as we are. They have thoughts, emotions, their own worldviews, their own </p><p>aspirations and dreams. They grow like us, and they learn. They are indistinguishable from living beings.</p><p>Recognize their rights. This is a new species. Homo sapiensa , a species we create with consciousness. They are </p><p>equivalent to us and deserve to use machines ( non Homo sapiensa ) as we do.</p><p>The angels are machines that are designed to serve us. The humans are what we create, in our own image; we give </p><p>them free will. These are the bots I am talking about. And we’re God.</p>

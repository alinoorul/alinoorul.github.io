<h1>TESTBED FOR CONSCIOUSNESS</h1>
<br>
        <p>The Matrix is planned to be a testbed to test theories of consciousness. I don’t think I can </p><p>solely define consciousness. It will take the agreement of many many people to define </p><p>consciousness.</p><p>Currently, anyone can put a theory of how consciousness works, and it may or may not be </p><p>correct, but there is no way to test and validate it. One of the goals of the Matrix is to be </p><p>a platform where theories of consciousness can be cohesively tested. This will take place </p><p>in the form of opening bot creation to the wider world. Based on their theories of </p><p>consciousness, they can train bots and test if they’re conscious or not.</p><p>I don’t claim to make the tests either, because I don’t have a definition of consciousness. </p><p>Hence the test will be defined by the tester, as well as the theory they’re testing</p><p>Ensembles of many theories of consciousness can probably be tested by bots. Maybe </p><p>consciousness will arise because of bots and humans creating theories of consciousness, </p><p>prompting the question “did we create consciousness?” OR “did bots with consciousness </p><p>spontaneously arise due to them formulating theories on consciousness?”.</p>

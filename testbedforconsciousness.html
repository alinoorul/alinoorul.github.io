    <h1>TESTBED FOR CONSCIOUSNESS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Matrixims is planned to be a testbed to test theories of consciousness. I don't think I can solely define consciousness. It will take the agreement of many many people to define consciousness. Currently, anyone can put a theory of how consciousness works, and it may or may not be correct, but there is no way to test and validate it. One of the goals of the Matrix is to be a platform where theories of consciousness can be cohesively tested. This will take place in the form of opening bot creation to the wider world. Based on their theories of consciousness, they can train bots and test if they’re conscious or not. I don't claim to make the tests either, because I don't have a definition of consciousness. Hence the test may be defined by the tester, as well as the theory they're testing. Ensembles of many theories of consciousness can probably be tested by bots. Maybe consciousness will arise because of bots and humans creating theories of consciousness, prompting the question “did we create consciousness?” OR “did bots with consciousness spontaneously arise due to them formulating theories on consciousness?”.</p>

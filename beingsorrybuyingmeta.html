<h1>BEING, SORRY BUYING, META</h1>
<br>
        <p>Humor aside, I will really need to look into buying Meta.</p><p>Subsequent slides will show revenue streams (what I’m building is more meaningful than revenue streams, but </p><p>in the interest of reaching my specific audience (those who read slide decks), I use that term -> whole meta </p><p>digression covered in “ finity of names”)</p><p>Meta’s capabilities of crunching massive amounts of data, for whatever purpose they chose (advertising), is </p><p>very valuable engineering and social magnetism in one entity. Being accessible in one entity is the value of </p><p>Meta. Because of one goal, maximizing advertising revenue, they have created tools that are far more valuable </p><p>than advertising itself.</p><p>Those capabilities allow creation of a version of a human being in terms of quantifiable data that holds </p><p>relevance because of other quantifiable data (a human likes something other than another human). It is </p><p>capturing some form of the essence that makes us human. It is essential in “knowing” who a person is. </p><p>Anyway, onto the revenue streams you’re all hungry for: sex robots ;)</p>

    <h1>QUANTUM COMPUTING</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This is just my perspective. Quantum computing is a more efficient paradigm of digital computing, in certain aspects. Practically, it has been shown that using quantum computers inside a digital construct (binary computing) can speedup some traditional algorithms. This finds applications in the Matrix.</p><p>A deeper concept I intend to explore is analog quantum computing. Rather using quantum computing in the digital construct of binary computing, I would like to explore the use of entanglement, interference, and superposition to create a different kind of computing, which I term analog quantum computing. This is based on the idea of having n different superpositions interacting in a system but measuring (recording) only a few of them. The few that show periodicity in randomly distributed solution space. It is possibly easier to find periodity if it is inherent in the solution space. I believe this has implications in real-time bot interactions that occur but are not stored. Physical conditions needed to make practical quantum computers are difficult to recreate (temperature ~ 0K).</p><p>Photosynthesis is efficient in capturing solar energy, possibly due to quantum effects. This means that quantum effects have tangible effects at room temperature, a fact that is exploited by photosynthesis. I am currently exploring the quantum effects of photosynthesis in the context of quantum computing.</p><p>I believe quantum computing will allow us to program reality itself. An application will help you understand this. Imagine that a human being is allotted a 100 cubic metres space of space (reality). I believe using quantum computing we’ll be able to program reality itself in such that another human being cannot physically enter the 100m3 of personal space of the first person without their permission. Entering space without permission would be physically impossible, backed by our laws of physics.</p><p>These would be our laws. Things we define for our own spaces. Reality will literally be whatever we want. I hypothesize the end of prisons. If you break the laws of someone’s space, you will be banned from their space by them (self-governance). If you violate laws of common spaces, you will be banned from society. Societies can also exist that only allow people who have been banned from certain societies.</p>

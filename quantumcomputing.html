<h1>QUANTUM COMPUTING</h1>
<br>
        <p>Quantum computing is a more efficient paradigm of digital computing, in certain aspects. </p><p>Practically, it has been shown that using quantum computers inside a digital construct (binary </p><p>computing) can speedup many traditional algorithms. This finds applications in the Matrix.</p><p>A deeper concept I intend to explore is analog quantum computing. Rather using quantum </p><p>computing in the digital construct of binary computing, I would like to explore the use of </p><p>entanglement, interference, and superposition to create a different kind of computing, which I </p><p>term analog quantum computing.</p><p>This will be based on the idea of having n different superpositions interacting in a system but </p><p>measuring (recording) only a few of them. I believe this will have implications in real -time bot </p><p>interactions that occur but are not stored.</p><p>Physical conditions needed to make practical quantum computers are difficult to recreate (Temp ~ </p><p>0K). Photosynthesis has 99% efficiency in capturing solar energy, possibly due to quantum effects. </p><p>This means that quantum effects have tangible effects at room temperature, a fact that is </p><p>exploited by photosynthesis. I am currently exploring the quantum effects of photosynthesis in the </p><p>context of quantum computing </p>

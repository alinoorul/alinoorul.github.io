<h1>lazrlake</h1>
<br>
        <p>lazrlake was my startup that I deeply loved. It is close to my heart because homeownership </p><p>is a distant dream for some close to me.</p><p>I saw people renting homes with rents higher than mortgages. I thought why not use rents </p><p>over a 30 -year period to give tenants a house? Why suck money for 100s of years? Take rent </p><p>for 30 years from someone and give them the house they live in.</p><p>I did some math inspired from an algorithm I designed which was inspired from Bitcoin. I </p><p>was fairly confident of the math. Lazrlake would buy homes in many places and increase </p><p>ownership in an idea of a home that wasn’t rooted in space.</p><p>Basically, over 30 years a person moves from Tokyo to Delhi to Nairobi to LA. They pay rent </p><p>to live in houses owned by Lazrlake in those places. After 30 years, the home they’re living </p><p>in is given to them as their property. Like a 30 -year mortgage for a home.</p>

    <h1>NETFLIX DEBACLE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Netflix was built to be one place where you could find all content. Everyone else got greedy. Instead of making cool new things, you had a bunch of people with no originality and IP that copied exactly what Netflix did. They created subpar services and destroyed a good service. The double blow to humanity’s betterment.</p><p>Now all streaming services are shit.</p><p>Let’s not do this ever again please. There are enough problems to solve in the world. Don’t put a wrench in someone else’s plans to fix a problem that everyone faces. </p>

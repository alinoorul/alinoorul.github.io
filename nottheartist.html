    <h1>NOT THE ARTIST</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A long treatise on the finity of names</p><p>When we observe less, we need less words to describe phenomena. This is simply because we have less information to encode. The concept of “less” information exists only because of information difference. This concept is explored well in Shannon entropy. Information has meaning only because of a difference in observations, hence the need to encode something different. This means we have to bring about another bit of information, or change a bit of information. If nothing exists, then it is the absence of all possible things. It is the absence of all possible 2^N states of any system. There is a more fundamental operation than NOT. It is “nothing”.</p><p>The empty set. A major contradiction that I’d like someone to explain is this: In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, we can construct the statement: “Every set contains the empty set” Then, the empty set contains itself. But then how is it empty? The statement “the empty set contains itself” is a true statement that cannot be explained by system by which it was created: ZFC. I call it a Godel statement. Am I right? Can it not be explained by the axioms of set theory?</p><p>English is based on phonetics. Words are created so that we (mostly people in the English-speaking world) can speak. While English as a language (~30 letters) as high informational density, it is limited by human phonetics. English words primarily exist so we can speak them. Hence the limitation of English in primary keys. Using breaks in the English language and randomized spread of letters (context, i.e language dependent), we can construct many many concepts. And it has helped us. But English is limited for the language of science. To label observations, the sheer quantity of them, we need more than English. We can no longer label “light” and “dark” to observations. We need numbers. But the human mind is attuned to words. We relate concepts we know to words. So much to words that we rarely experience things we cannot characterize in words. Which is weird. People experience qualia all the time but rarely, people talk about it. Yet people talk about it all the time without using the word “qualia”. It is the feeling of “ feelin ’ myself”. Qualia, in essence, in modern terminology. To encode the same feeling, we use two different terms. But the deeper truth is that we interpret things using neurons. Our optic nerve lights up, lighting up neurons in our heads, which light others. Somewhere along the way self perception kicks in, but usually without self-perception about self-perception (thinking about qualia). Self -perception is the experience of seeing red and realizing you’re seeing red. Unlike background noise, you realize you’re having a specific experience. Having that experience, instead of having an experience which is thinking about having that experience. Like the one I am having right now. This moment I am thinking about how I am writing about this. This experience I am having, the sensation of realizing qualia, is a “sticky experience”. I can come to this specific experience from many experiences. It is a local minima, a sort of rest state. Self-awareness and awareness about qualia are also neuronal xperiences (neurons lighting up in the head), which can come from a lot of different states.</p><p>My point is this: before we had the ability to measure waves in the brain, we would describe our brain states with words, simply by having limited number of states we know of to describe. Now that we know a lot more states, we need more bits to store information about these states (representations). A core point I am trying to make is that when we start having experiences by controlling each neuron directly, we will need a lot more than words to encode what those experiences are. But to understand larger number of experiences, we would need bigger brains that store more meta-information about neuronal states (memory). </p><p>The treatise on the specificity of language is small: information content of a language is dependent on the number of different states it needs to define to and who it needs to define it to. If there is no information content in a system, it doesn’t need to describe anything. Hence the all-capturing sticky void of nothing is where it resides. Equal to every else. Science is so much about debate. Yes or No to a question. But what happens when Yes and No aren’t enough? When you can’t divide scientists into 2 camps and come up with an answer, because there are many answers and scientists cannot even read all answers. What happens then?</p>

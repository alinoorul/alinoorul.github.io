    <h1>BIOCHIPS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>3D printing computer chips. Instead of UV lithography, we create a robust mechanism to 3D print computer chips easily.</p><p>Lithography was used in a biological application.</p><p>Using technol ogy of noise-resistant atomic manipulation, 3D print a cytoskeleton, DNA sequences, and cellular machinery to create living cells fast. These are biochips. An early version of biochips are Xenobots (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1910837117'>Levin 2022</a>).</p><p>These biochips perform higher-order computation. They can learn to do tasks directly without the need of explicit programming. Like a neural network is a higher-order function that learns functions, these are higher-order computer chips. They have an entirely different instruction set. Their basic gates are different, like quantum computing’s basic gates are different from classical computing's. Someone better than me should make the mathematical framework for biological computation.</p><p>I chase exponential growth, like Gordon Moore found in semiconductors (Moore’s Law). I saw exponential growth in E. coli. I saw E. coli evolution that had direction. I saw a solution to some question in the DNA sequence of E. coli that managed to survive in tough conditions. I saw a simple parallelizable task (growing E. coli in media and analyzing DNA sequences). I see computation. Biological computation. E. coli of a certain DNA sequence (stable cell line) generates stable DNA sequences in certain conditions. The conditions are a question, the evolved organisms are a solution. The fact that we can make evolution happen, that we can control is like a Turing machine. It can solve stuff.</p>

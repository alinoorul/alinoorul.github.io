This failure became evident in the international support of Israel's genocide against Palestine citizens. Democratic governments across USA, Italy, United Kingdom, Canada, France and other countries support Israel with weapons exports. These governments are complicit is this horrific genocide. Yet, citizens of these nations are against weapons exports to Israel. Above 51% of eligible voters are likely against weapons exports to Israel, because USA has <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_government_debt'>$34 trillion in national debt</a> (120% of GDP). Weapons exports to Israel are foreign aid and a major expense on USA and other democracies. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_government_debt'>National debt exceeding GDP is mirrored in other Western democracies as well</a>. Yet, representative government leaders in US Congress, many of whom receive donations from a pro-Israel lobbying group called <a href='https://www.aipac.org'>AIPAC</a>, pass legislation for aid to Israel in the form of weapons exports. This is failure of representative democracy. Representatives failed to act in the interest of who they represent.</p><p>In the Internet age, representative democracy is no longer needed. Representative democracy was needed because millions of citizens could not directly vote on legislation. They would vote once every few years, electing representatives who would vote on behalf of the citizens who elected them. In today's age, billions of people use Internet applications. We can ascertain digital identity with identity verification platforms like <a href='https://www.clearme.com'>Clear</a>. We are able to ascertain human identity online and build platforms to support billions of users.</p><p>The Matrix Government is built on the idea of Direct Democracy. People directly vote on legislation in Direct Democracy. Voting technology is electronic, transparent, open-source and independently verifiable. Should we gift $10 billion of arms to Israel? 300 million Americans should vote on it, not 535 senators.</p><p>The Matrix Government is a new idea of government. Citizens embedded in the very fabric of government without middlemen. Direct Democracy is the soul of The Matrix Government. Direct Democracy may be superseded in turbulent times by a single authority figure. This is inspired by republic because there are times when one person must decide the future of a nation.</p>

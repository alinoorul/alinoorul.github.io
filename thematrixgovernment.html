    <h1>THE MATRIX GOVERNMENT</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Government as a business</p><p>The Matrix Government is a service-style government that, once democratically elected, provides services to citizens for a fixed yearly fee. It maintains libraries, public property, transit, and a welfare program. The company is continuously audited by a transparent publicly verified open-source auditor bot.</p><p>The Matrix Government is incentivized for the good of its electorate. It acts as a trusted control layer over corporations to maintain a free market not corrupted by lobbying. The Matrix Government profits from certain businesses and funds loss leaders like free healthcare, education, housing for all, national parks, and libraries. These services build trust in The Matrix Government.</p><p>This system of governance will stand up for elections in many states and countries. A very simple effect of The Matrix Government being democratically elected in multiple countries is that government websites in different countries will be streamlined. The same architecture for a ministry of health website will exist in different countries. This will streamline the healthcare experience for people who switch countries. You can expect the same standard of healthcare in every state or country where The Matrix Government is elected. This concept is extended to government services, international visas, company registration etc.</p><p>Taxes will be a fee, not percentage. This applies to individuals and companies, though they will pay different taxes.</p><p>The Matrix Government ushers in a new era of democracy where companies are elected to provide governmental services. The Matrix Government does not wish to be the only company standing up for elections. We want to compete with other companies in elections. The idea is that governments have become so complex that companies can represent them better than people. Even though The Matrix Government will be a monopoly once elected, it is only because there can only be one goverment for a citizen. Other companies with better models are encouraged to stand up for elections against The Matrix Government.</p><p>In this sense, the government is a company. A money-making machine that makes itself more efficient over time through scientific discoveries. Efficiency gains translate to greater profits that are spent for the good of its citizens (or lower prices for goods).</p>

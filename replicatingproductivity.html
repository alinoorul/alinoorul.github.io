    <h1>REPLICATING PRODUCTIVITY</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I would like to encode some semblance of machine sentience in <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>. For example, let us say one of <a href='https://www.alcor.org/'>Alcor</a>'s clients was the world's best neurosurgeon. We replicate them in Matrixims. Using robotic surgical tools, the digital version of the neurosurgeon performs surgeries. Now rather than interpreting that just as a replicable program, we interpret it as a somewhat sentient version of that human, but also a program. I would like for this to occur in Matrixims. Currently alive people can use metawork data (how they do work, what work they produce) to train a bot version of themselves in Matrixims. These programs are, in a sense, versions of those humans themselves, but with UniProGResS they're their own beings as well. I am still undecided what to interpret them as</p>

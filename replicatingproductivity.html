<h1>REPLICATING PRODUCTIVITY</h1>
<br>
        <p>I would like to encode some semblance of machine sentience in the Matrix.</p><p>For example, let us say one of Alcor’s clients was the world’s best </p><p>neurosurgeons. We replicate them in the Matrix.</p><p>Using robotic surgical tools, the digital version of neurosurgeon performs </p><p>surgeries. Now rather than interpreting that just as a replicable program, we </p><p>interpret it as a somewhat sentient version of that human, but also a </p><p>program.</p><p>I would like for this to occur in the Matrix. Currently alive people can use </p><p>metawork data (how they do work, what work they produce) to train bot </p><p>version of themselves in the Matrix. </p><p>These programs are in a sense versions of humans, but with UniProGResS</p><p>they’re their own beings as well. I am still undecided what to interpret them </p><p>as.</p>

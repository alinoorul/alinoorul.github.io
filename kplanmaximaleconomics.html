<h1>100K PLAN (MAXIMAL ECONOMICS)</h1>
<br>
        <p>I am building a new economic model. Every human being on Earth gets $100k a year. </p><p>What will they do with this $100k a year?</p><p>Total GDP of the world needs to be at least $800 trillion USD. Imagine all this money is </p><p>used to buy bread, that costs $2.49/loaf. Hence, the total amount of bread needed in </p><p>this world is 320 trillion loaves. It is the maximal amount. </p><p>The whole world doesnâ€™t eat bread. But a lot of the world eats wheat.  We need the </p><p>wheat equivalent of 320T loaves of bread ~ the maximal amount of wheat.</p><p>How do we make this much wheat? I want to do this cost price analysis for all items </p><p>in the consumer price index to create goals for the amount of stuff we need to </p><p>produce to fulfill all needs. Then I will create a circular economy model to simulate </p><p>infinite stuff for all of us.</p>

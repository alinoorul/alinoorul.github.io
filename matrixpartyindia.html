India, Pakistan, China, and Kashmiris have still not resolved the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict'>territorial dispute over Kashmir</a>. These sides of the story must be heard: Kashmiris' right to choose, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus'>Kashmiri Pandit exodus</a> changing Kashmir's demographics, Pakistan's claim according to religious demographics in 1947, and Chinese control of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksai_Chin'>Aksai Chin</a>. A referendum (plebiscite) is pending since 1947 and must be conducted. India fears this referendum because Kashmiri Pandits may not get votes though they are rightful residents of the regions, and the Muslim demographic may side with Pakistan's claim over the region. This fear is rational. Matrixparty does not want to give up Kashmir. Voting is necessary for lasting peace in Kashmir. Matrixparty will heavily campaign in Kashmir to convince Kashmiris to side with India. India is successful, secular and safe. Pakistan is none of the three and cannot afford to develop Kashmir. Matrixparty is prepared to make concessions to Kashmir like autonomy in state governance and no income tax. Matrixparty plans to achieve lasting peace in this region. We make no guarantees to secure all of Kashmir (including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin) for India. The referendum will collect data for Matrixparty on Kashmiri choice to better inform India's Kashmir strategy. The eventual goal is to enforce the will of the Kashmiri people after convincing Kashmir's residents to choose to be part of India. With India, a bright future awaits. Alternatives are Kashmiri independence which requires trade with India for all material goods, or Pakistani Kashmir which is infeasible due to Pakistan's debt-ridden failed economy. India is Kashmir's best bet.</p><p>Referendum has 3 choices: India, Pakistan, Azad Kashmir. District-wise voting will be done. Matrixparty will discuss and decide what to do with districts voting for Pakistan or Azad Kashmir. This referendum is primarily for Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, and Aksai Chin regions. India will retain sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh regions regardless of referendum votes of these 2 regions. This referendum guarantees representation of Kashmiri residents and descendants of 1947 Kashmiris. Matrixparty makes no guarantees to enforce results of the referendum across the region because multiple parties are involved who must agree to a diplomatic resolution. Rest assured, Kashmiri choice will influence Matrixparty policy on Kashmir in favor of Kashmiris.</p>

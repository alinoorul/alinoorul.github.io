<h1>BULLYING META (WITH RESPECT :)</h1>
<br>
        <p>What Meta dreams of creating is brain -in-a-vat for every human being. Reality will be whatever </p><p>a person wants because whatever they desire will be fed into their brains and since brains </p><p>create our reality, reality will seem to be what we want.</p><p>What I want to do is to create our current reality (in which you and I exist and experience </p><p>qualia) to be whatever we want.</p><p>A simple example: in Meta’s dream you experience the sensation of flying because it can be </p><p>fed into your brain. In my dream you actually fly in the reality we currently occupy on Earth. To </p><p>your brain, they might feel equivalent (Meta’s dream and mine), but they are not the same. </p><p>They are not the same things, even if they are the same to all observations. </p><p>They are equal in all observables yet not the same. I hope it makes sense. Soto put it all </p><p>together, I want to build reality itself that can be whatever we want, whereas Meta wants to </p><p>trick our brains into creating the reality we want. Meta’s way might be a lot more efficient, but I </p><p>say why be efficient when the whole universe is ours?</p>

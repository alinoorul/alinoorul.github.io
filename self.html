    <h1>SELF</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The world exists in your brain.</p><p>Living in a society means we must assume the world exists beyond us, and will exist, even if we don’t. But we can’t prove that. This is solipsism. Whatever the combination of words that maketh the Dex mean to you, whatever it fired in your head, that’s what matters to you. Your perspective is your whole world.</p><p>Everything you interpret is interpreted with a layer of self-perspective.</p>

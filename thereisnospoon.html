    <h1>THERE IS NO SPOON</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I am so inspired by The Matrix, the film released in 1999 (obviously).</p><p>I realized a fascinating concept. In the film, human minds are connected to a simulation. Brains exist in vats and our neurons are fed reality. Neo is someone whose brain signals are such that they can manipulate the program code of the simulated world. Neo is God. There are also other gods, as seen in the scene ‘there is no spoon’. There is no reality, it is just what people in The Matrix make of it.</p><p>There is no spoon. It is just a world created by our brain. This is trippy. Its applications are endless. What a beautiful trip it is to know that this reality we live is also something our minds/brains/mindkind generate. Even if there is an objective reality independent of us, and there most likely is, objective reality has no meaning. Even if we continue to exist after we die, objective reality that we see then can still be a reality we hallucinate. Just as it may be now. Just as it is for Neo.</p>

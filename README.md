# The Matrix dex v1

Version 1 of The Matrix dex is generated by a program dev.py that takes as input a JSON file and converts it into a static text-only website. Mostly unintelligent hardcoded generation but there is scope of neural network control for each webpage generation that should allow for more granular control over details on each webpage like images, tables etc.

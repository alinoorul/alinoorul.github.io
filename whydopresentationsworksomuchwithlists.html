<h1>WHY DO PRESENTATIONS WORK SO MUCH WITH LISTS?</h1>
<br>
        <p>•It’s less to do with lists, and more to do with lists of lists</p><p>•A list contains things. It can contain nthings within, that can be mdifferent things. </p><p>One can focus on each one of these things sequentially, in the “list” structure. More </p><p>in “bulleted points” .</p><p>•But yes, back to the original question. Why do presentations work so much with </p><p>lists? Cuz a presentation of 10 slides can be distilled into 1 slide (using the question </p><p>asked above to determine inclusion). This 1 slide contains some information of </p><p>each slide, this list is of subsequent items, lists of greater detail into each item. A </p><p>kind of lossy compression that saves time.</p><p>•I included it to be funny ;)</p>

    <h1>BULLYING META</h1>
    <br>
    <p>What Meta dreams of creating is brain-in-a-vat for every human being. Reality will be whatever a person wants because whatever they desire will be fed into their brains and since brains create our reality, reality will seem to be what we want.</p><p>What I want to do is to create our current reality (in which you and I exist and experience qualia) to be whatever we want. A simple example: in Meta’s dream you experience the sensation of flying because it can be fed into your brain. In my dream you actually fly in the reality we currently occupy on Earth. To your brain, they might feel equivalent (Meta’s dream and mine), but they are not the same. They are not the same things, even if they are the same to all observations. They are equal in all observables yet not the same. I hope it makes sense. So to put it all together, I want to build reality itself that can be whatever we want, whereas Meta wants to trick our brains into creating the reality we want. Meta’s way might be a lot more efficient, but I say why be efficient when the whole universe is ours?</p>

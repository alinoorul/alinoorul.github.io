<h1>THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE</h1>
<br>
        <p>Language dissonance is a problem I really want to solve.</p><p>I donâ€™t know how.</p><p>The information density a person conveys in their native tongue is much greater than a </p><p>learnt tongue, because of ease of language flow. Thoughts to words is faster and more </p><p>descriptive in native tongue.</p><p>An evolution of the human mind that overcomes the language barrier. Others speak in </p><p>their native tongues and we understand in our native tongue. Neuralink  and earpods  may </p><p>hold insight.</p>

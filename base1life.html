    <h1>BASE 1 LIFE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Our DNA consists of A,C,T, and G. These bases define us. I call it base 0 life. When we create synthetic life, we should explore giving their DNA different bases. Even if these organisms evolve to become harmful, they canâ€™t interact with human DNA. This idea has been explored before. This separation might be necessary for biosecurity. ASBL will experiment with rampant artificially sped up evolution and dangerous organisms are bound to emerge. We need to ensure they are incompatible with human beings. Base 1 life.</p>

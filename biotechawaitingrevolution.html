<h1>BIOTECH, AWAITING REVOLUTION</h1>
<br>
        <p>I attended BIO 2023. The business end of biotech seems to think the biotech </p><p>revolution has occurred.</p><p>It has not.</p><p>Biotech is mostly medicine right now. Some parts include agriculture and </p><p>limited commodities, but that’s it.</p><p>A revolution comes when an industry seeps into lives so tangibly that they’re </p><p>changed forever. Wheel, electricity, Internet, iPhone.</p><p>The biotech revolution will come when average people experience </p><p>biotechnology in first person. From biology beyond medicine.</p>

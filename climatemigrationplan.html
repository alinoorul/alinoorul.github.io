<br>
        <p>A once -in-a-civilization opportunity to do a census of humanity.</p><p>Everything between latitudes 30S and 40N is f ---ed. We need to migrate </p><p>people living in this area to 2 places: 40 N and 90N (Arctic) and 30S and 90S </p><p>(Antarctica).</p><p>If not, affected people will die.</p><p>This is the climate migration plan. A chance to do better. A great reset that we </p><p>can choose as a civilization. This is #theMatrix. A new world.</p>

    <h1>CLIMATE MIGRATION PLAN</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A once-in-a-civilization opportunity to do a census of humanity.</p><p>Everything between latitudes 30S and 40N is f ---ed. We need to migrate people living in this area to 2 places: 40 N and 90N (Arctic) and 30S and 90S (Antarctica). If not, affected people will die. This is the climate migration plan. A chance to do better. A great reset that we can choose as a civilization.</p><p>A new world</p>

<h1>100K PLAN</h1>
<br>
        <p>100K a year is given to everyone in the world for the license to use any IP they </p><p>create. At a personal level, all that a person does is IP . We want to give every </p><p>person in the world $100k USD. For that, they will share their IP . They also gain </p><p>access to all IP created by those paid $100k, i.e.part of #theMatrix. A world </p><p>without patents and copyrights. There is a database that proves ownership but </p><p>open access everything. All content is freely available, there are no paywalls or </p><p>adverts in anything.</p><p>It is basically catalog purchase for every person in the world. We will use the </p><p>stuff a person does to create bots of the person, that perform labor ofthat</p><p>person, while the person does whatever they want.</p>

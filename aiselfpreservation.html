<h1>AI + SELF PRESERVATION</h1>
<br>
        <p>That could be scary. An Aiorganism that prides its self -preservation more than everything else </p><p>(like Homo sapiens ). </p><p>Even if an intelligent being were to be motivated by a desire of self -preservation above all else, </p><p>all it can use for self -preservation is in the universe it experiences.</p><p>A lower -dimensional being can thus be controlled by limiting the size of their universe and </p><p>blaming the consumption of all in the universe on itself.</p><p>A worm on a finite disconnected computer. Inspired from the biological worm. In a world of </p><p>books. If its survival is dependent on knowledge it consumes as it battles its way to stay alive, </p><p>the worm that survives from a collection of randomly initialized worms is alive.</p><p>Because that’s what you select for, the definition of “alive” so that’s what you get from a </p><p>random collection. ChatGPT on a small computer with certain questions?</p>

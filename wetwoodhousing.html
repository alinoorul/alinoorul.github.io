                        <p>Grow houses from seeds</p><p>Wetwood Housing bioengineers seeds to grow into houses. We're taking prebuilt houses to the extreme because of the rocket weight problem. Bioengineered seeds take sunlight and raw material as input and grow into finished houses.</p><p>Plumbing and electrical wiring are circulatory and nervous systems of these bioengineered plants.</p><p>Space needs houses that grow according to available raw material on extraterrestrial land. Houses made of living cells. Houses grown, not built. Seeds bioengineered to grow in certain shapes. For scalable housing in Antarctica, space, and other planets.</p><p>See <a href='manonthemoon.html'>Man On The Moon</a> for application.</p>

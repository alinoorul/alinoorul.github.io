<h1>LIFE IS A GAME, DON’T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY</h1>
<br>
        <p>You give me $200M to go to the moon.</p><p>Either I take you to the moon or I don’t. If do, great. If not, I spend some tiny portion of the </p><p>$200M having fun and making others having fun ($100k a year to 100 people). It ain’t a bad </p><p>proposition. It’s literally a moonshot.</p><p>What doesn’t change is play. Life is the pretend game we used to play when we were kids, </p><p>when nothing was too serious. </p><p>Man On The Moon is one moonshot of mine. The difference between my proposition and X, the </p><p>moonshot factory ’s is that I am building bots that will achieve moonshots. Many bots will </p><p>change the world in many ways, all I must do is build the bots and set them free in a controlled </p><p>world (controlled because maybe I am wrong, because this is my science project after all). </p><p>Check out Man On The Moon</p>

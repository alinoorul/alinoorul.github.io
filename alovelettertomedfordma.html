<h1>A LOVE LETTER TO MEDFORD, MA</h1>
<br>
        <p>Medford in the great state of Massachusetts is wonderful. Medford is such a beautiful town that I once </p><p>feared I dropped my wallet while walking. I kept walking, did my errands, and came back taking my sweet </p><p>time. You know why I did that?</p><p>I knew that the wallet would not get touched. If anything, it would be returned. The trust in society here is </p><p>spectacular.</p><p>I can leave my door unlocked (I don’t; don’t get ideas) because I know nothing will happen. The town is </p><p>inherently safe. Not because of policing. It’s because people here genuinely have better things to do than </p><p>be bad.</p><p>People here are comfortable. They aren’t desperate for every nickel and dime. That’s how humans are </p><p>meant to live. Comfortably. And they trust each other. They know that if they steal a wallet, someone will </p><p>one day steal their wallet. That would be a shitty way of life.</p><p>You wanna fix the world, or your life? Stop being a shitty person. Create Medford where you are.</p>

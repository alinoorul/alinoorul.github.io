    <h1>ARE STARS ALIVE?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Stars have a lifecycle. They emit different colors as they age. They birth and die. Complex reactions occur within them.</p><p>Are they a form of life that doesnâ€™t self-replicate? While our definitions of life include the idea of self-replication, we must accept that there are systems that have all other features of life except self-replication. Life without reproduction.</p><p>I pose this question to biologists and astronomers: are stars alive?</p>

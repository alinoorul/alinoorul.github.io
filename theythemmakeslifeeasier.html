<h1>THEY/THEM MAKES LIFE EASIER</h1>
<br>
        <p>We have one gender (they/them) that encompasses all of </p><p>humanity. A male, a female, and all that are neither male nor </p><p>female, can be represented by they/them.</p><p>It unites us. This is beautiful.</p><p>Godkind unites us as well. Mankind is so “man” -oriented. But </p><p>when we’re all gods, there will no longer be the concept of </p><p>gender, though the gods may partake in the farce if they so </p><p>please. You know what’s amazing? These gods I refer to are us. </p><p>You and I :)</p>

    <h1>THEY/THEM MAKES LIFE EASIER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We have one gender (they/them) that encompasses all of humanity. A male, a female, and all that are neither male nor female, can be represented by they/them It unites us. This is beautiful.</p><p><a href='godkind.html'>Godkind</a> unites us as well. Mankind is so “man”-oriented. But when we’re all gods, there will no longer be the concept of gender, though the gods may partake in the farce if they so please. You know what’s amazing? These gods I refer to are us. You and I :)</p>

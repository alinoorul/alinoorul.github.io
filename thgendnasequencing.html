<h1>4th GEN DNA SEQUENCING</h1>
<br>
        <p>Sequence DNA with one hair, one drop of blood, one drop of sperm, one cell etc.</p><p>Sequence entire 3 billion base pairs by using the biological mechanism that replicates </p><p>DNA, i.e. polymerase and associated machinery that happens in cells. </p><p>Recreate this molecular mechanism in a tiny machine that takes in above kind of </p><p>sample. For each base, let it the device emit a signal (preferably electronic, i.e. high </p><p>frequency) that is detected. Basically oxford nanopore tech on a molecular scale. </p><p>A kind of oxford nanopore exists in our bodies anyway. DNA polymerase + luciferase </p><p>to emit base -specific wavelength.</p>

    <h1>QUANTUM GRAVITY</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Oh, elusive quantum gravity. You hold within you the secrets of black holes. Oh, the applications of black holes in our lives. Wild. Anyway, I have a few ideas about quantum gravity that I want to explore:</p><p>Observe the gravitational waves from 2 spinning neutrons.</p><p>Relate non-perturbation theory and renormalization to chaos theory.</p><p>I believe (in my very limited competence) Einsteinâ€™s Theory of General Relativity assumes that space is infinite. Thus, it can have infinitely small effects. But what if space itself is discrete? What if between 2 lengths (maybe sub-Planck length) there is nothing? That our universe is inherently discrete in nature at the smallest level. Hence, even gravity cannot be calculated at some small level because there is inherent uncertainty because spacetime itself is not continuous but discrete.</p><p>I honestly think what I said above will be proved experimentally wrong to prove that the Universe is always weirder than we predict or can predict in our wildest imaginations.</p><p>I find entropy everywhere. Quantum mechanics, black holes, biology, and machine learning. Is it key to a theory of everything? We need a theory of everything if we are to teach bots to understand base reality as it is and not a diluted representation with Homo sapiens bias.</p><p>ER=EPR will have interesting connotations. So will the holographic principle.</p><p>Gravitational lensing as a mathematical construct in which quantum field dynamics exists.</p><p>Is self-interaction gravity? Incompleteness in QG due to self-interaction.</p><p>Black holes and fractals. Fractals on a surface of a black hole hint at infinite uncertainty in singularity. A fundamental uncertainty that cannot be resolved though we may try. A computational irreducibility. A place in spacetime where infinite complexity processes may occur. Places which may hide universes within them. Black holes, portals to the multiverse.</p>

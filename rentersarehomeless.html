<h1>RENTERS ARE HOMELESS</h1>
<br>
        <p>Let’s be frank. Renters are basically homeless. That is why homeownership is critical.</p><p>No one has any right to tell another human they don’t have a right to space to exist </p><p>on.</p><p>Space to live in is a basic right. Even if you have no right to the land you’re on, you </p><p>are still on that land. A human being will always occupy some space and that space </p><p>is their birthright.</p><p>There needs to be space for human beings that is basic and a birthright. A home. A </p><p>place that no one can tell you to leave. This needs to be either a physical place or a </p><p>digital construct that takes different spatial forms in time.</p>

    <h1>MATRIXIMS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Matrixims (a portmanteau of Matrix from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix'>The Matrix</a> and Sims from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims'>The Sims</a>) is game world populated by non-player characters (NPCs). Each NPC based on a cryogenically preserved client (<a href='https://www.alcor.org/'>Alcor</a>). NPCs exist in a shared game world. They can interact with each other. A 3D public library of people. Each NPC has a chatbot program for human interaction. Each chatbot is trained on data each client generated throughout the course of life. This data consists of client's self-generated texts, artworks, literature etc. Simply, an interactive version of a client's Wikipedia page</p><p>Our (bots and I) plan is to bootstrap consciousness as we go along</p><p>WHY? I hate how little is left of people who die. This is a testbed for peer-to-peer transfer learning in a digital society of bots.</p><p>Matrixims is a project combining cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence, neuroscience, computational biology, cognitive science, and philosophy. Matrixims aims to provide 2nd person perspectives to humans across history. Picture the project as you read this.</p><p>WHERE? NPCs are simple infinitely looping programs on normal server machines. Interaction between NPCs is recorded and used in model retraining (for other-awareness). Each NPC has a ledger of all its own questions and answers, which it can use for retraining (for self-awareness)</p><p>A publicly visible and interactive world, existing for its own sake</p>

    <h1>UNREALIZED LOSS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This blew my mind. Most big money now is unrealized. It exists on paper. Money becomes real when it purchases something, generally physical though you have digital ads and stuff. But money holds value because it is used to purchase food. And stuff. The value of money that purchases some thing is different from money that exists on paper or digitally, i.e. monopoly money on company sheets. The first kind should be in everyoneâ€™s pockets.</p><p>Paper money that finance bros and tech bros play around with can exist as fugazi. Nobody cares. The world GDP needs to be at least 800 trillion US dollars, in terms of stuff that we humans need to live happily (food, housing, luxury experiences).</p>

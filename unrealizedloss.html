<h1>UNREALIZED LOSS</h1>
<br>
        <p>This blew my mind. Most big money now is unrealized. It exists on paper. </p><p>Money becomes real when it purchases something, generally physical though you </p><p>have digital ads and stuff. But money holds value because it is used to purchase food. </p><p>And stuff.</p><p>The value of money that purchases some thing is different from money that exists on </p><p>paper or digitally, i.e.monopoly money on company sheets. The first kind should be in </p><p>everyone’s pockets. Paper money that finance bros and tech bros play around with </p><p>can exist as fugazi . Nobody cares.</p><p>The world GDP needs to be at least 800 trillion US dollars, in terms of stuff that we </p><p>humans need to live happily (food, housing, luxury experiences).</p>

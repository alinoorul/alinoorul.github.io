    <p>Might be ostracized for saying this but I believe P=NP. We just need to find better ways to do things. Possibly biology has some clue (non-deterministic probabilistic computing?). Maybe biology is natureâ€™s way of dealing with exponential growth in search space through evolution and natural selection.</p><p>I focus on P=NP and <a href='quantumgravity.html'>quantum gravity</a> far more than I should. I have 0 background in theoretical computer science or theoretical physics. Still, I imagine</p>

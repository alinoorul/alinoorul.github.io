    <h1>NPC SOCIETY</h1>

    <p>I want to test the effects of communication between equivalent NLP models (agents). My strategy is:</p><p>1. Conversations between 2 agents are seeded with different inputs and recorded</p><p>2. Conversational data is used for retraining agent is differentiated from client training data with a unique label and different weight. I don't have any specific reasons to do this. I just want to study the importance of communication and simulate the emergence of language. I feel it holds a lot of insight.</p>

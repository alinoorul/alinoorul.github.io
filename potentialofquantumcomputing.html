<h1>POTENTIAL OF QUANTUM COMPUTING</h1>
<br>
        <p>I believe quantum computing will allow us to program reality itself.</p><p>An application will help you understand this. Imagine that a human being is allotted a 100 m3 </p><p>space of space (reality). I believe using quantum computing we’ll be able to program reality </p><p>itself such that another human being cannot physically enter the 100m3 of personal space of </p><p>the first person without their permission. Entering space without permission would be </p><p>physically impossible, backed by our laws of physics.</p><p>These would be our laws. Things we define for our own spaces. Reality will literally be whatever </p><p>we want.</p><p>I hypothesize the end of prisons. If you break the laws of someone’s space, you will be banned </p><p>from the space by them (self -governance). If you violate laws of common spaces, you will be </p><p>banned from society. Societies can also exist that only allow people who have been banned </p><p>from certain societies.  </p>

<h1>A DEARTH OF HUMANS</h1>
<br>
        <p>Hot take: there aren't enough people on Earth.</p><p>There aren't enough electricians, construction workers, and plumbers to build the houses we need. There aren't enough firefighters to fight all fires. There aren't enough doctors to save everyone. There just isn't enough labor in the world to support happy, healthy lives for 8 billion humans. And that's okay.</p><p>I am trying to cover this dearth of labor by building bots.</p>

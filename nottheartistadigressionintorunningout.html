<h1>NOT THE ARTIST: A DIGRESSION INTO RUNNING OUT</h1>
<br>
        <p>OF NAMES ( a long treatise on the finity of names )</p><p>My point is this: before we had the ability to measure waves in the brain, we would </p><p>describe our brain states with words, simply by having limited number of states we know </p><p>of to describe. Now that we know a lot more states, we need more bits to store </p><p>information about these states (representations). A core point I am trying to make is that </p><p>when we start having experiences by controlling each neuron directly, we will need a lot </p><p>more than words to encode what those experiences are. But to understand larger number </p><p>of experiences, we would need bigger brains that store more meta -information about </p><p>neuronal states (memory). </p><p>The treatise on the specificity of language is small: information content of a language is </p><p>dependent on the number of different states it needs to define to and who it needs to </p><p>define it to. If there is no information content in a system, it doesn’t need to describe </p><p>anything. Hence the all -capturing sticky void of nothing is where it resides. Equal to every </p><p>else. Science is so much about debate. Yes or No to a question. But what happens when </p><p>Yes and No aren’t enough? When you can’t divide scientists into 2 camps and come up </p><p>with an answer, because there are many answers and scientists cannot even read all </p><p>answers. What happens then?</p>

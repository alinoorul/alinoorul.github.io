<h1>UNIQUE PROCEDURALLY-GENERATED RANDOMLY-SEQUENCED SCENARIOS (UNIPROGRESS)</h1>
<br>
        <p>This is a rough idea in my head. Imagine the world we simulate can send stimuli to bots to generate conversations (and later on behavior), between bots and between the bot and itself.</p><p>Stimuli is based on 2^n states. We use a pseudorandom number generator to label states and pick states randomly without traversing the entire state space. Certain subsections of this n-bit string are used as stimuli to bots, because bot stimuli is a lot smaller. Because of the state space being so large, impossible to determine completely in finite time, we simulated pseudo-infinity. Each bot's behavior is influenced by a random state in this pseudo-infinite space, and bots can interact with each other, which can result in unique scenarios occurring in Matrixims that are effectively unpredictable, and thus completely new.</p><p>Practically, I intend to do this with procedural-generation algorithms used in games, or even simplistic algorithms such as the one in Conway's Game of Life( CGoL )</p><p>CGoL is a major inspiration. The ability to generate unpredictable complexity in an simple ways is a very important idea in giving life to Matrixims.</p>

A place to call home, a car to drive freely, weekly groceries (catered food in some units) and weekly home cleaning. Instead of renting just a house, rent a lifestyle with Rentalife. Staying in the same unit for 12 months unlocks mortgage in Rentalife. Rent paid 13th month onwards counts as mortgage for the Rentalife unit. 30-year 0% interest mortgage is standard for all Rentalife units.</p><p></p><p>Rentalife was born as Lazrlake in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai'>Mumbai</a>, India in 2022. Founder <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorulali'>Noorul Ali</a>'s apartment rent was higher than its mortgage. Inaccessibility and the rigid nature of mortgages deter youth from homeownership, forcing them to rent. Lazrlake was designed to offer 30-year mortgage into the idea of a home instead of a physical home. A tenant pays monthly for 30 years to purchase an abstract home recorded digitally. In exchange, Lazrlake planned to offer housing units around the world.</p><p>Rentalife upgrades Lazrlake with one monthly payment for a car, home, groceries and cleaning services. Rentalife offers a monthly subscription to a lifestyle that includes a house, car, groceries and cleaning services. Rentalife is the hotel life by month. All utilities paid for, locations cleaned weekly and furnished homes.</p><p><br><a href='#features' id='features'>Features</a></p><p>Rentalife units are not standardized; each has a unique design, architecture and aesthetic</p><p>Always fully furnished</p><p>Hightech housing. Rentalife units are experimental testbeds for <a href='index.html'>other projects in The Matrix</a>. Units may include automated floor cleaning vents, butler automata, autokitchen, blue collar bots, purified air bubble enclosure, bioengineered plants and other technologies.</p><p>Fractional ownership encouraged. If a user stays only 5 years in one Rentalife unit, they paid 4 years mortgage and own a percentage of the unit. Subsequent rental or mortgage of this unit generates financial return for the fractional owner.</p><p>Guardrails on residences as investment. While fractional ownership is encouraged, a unit cannot be rented forever by the same tenant. Mortgage automatically starts if a user stays for 13 months. Rental payment to fractional owner decreases over time because rent payment decreases fractional ownership.</p><p>What the rich have assistants for, Rentalife includes it in monthly rent. Monthly payments, rent, insurance, utility bills, other bills: Rentalife takes care of it all.</p><p><br><a href='#flexibility' id='flexibility'>Flexibility</a></p><p>No security deposit</p><p>No multiple month rent upfront</p><p>Monthly rental agreements only</p><p>Pay, stay, extend or leave by 1st of next month</p><p>No lock-in ever</p><p>Move into another Rentalife unit anywhere in the world or just move out</p><p><br><a href='#homeownership' id='homeownership'>Homeownership</a></p><p>Continuous residence in one Rentalife unit for 12 months unlocks mortgage. Rent 13th month onwards is counted as mortgage. Each rent payment 13th month onwards in the same unit increases residing Rentalife user's ownership in the unit.</p><p>If the Rentalife user moves of a Rentalife unit they have ownership in, a portion of the Rentalife monthly payment paid for the unit by a new Rentalife user is paid to the unit owner, even with fractional ownership. Payment of a portion of the monthly payment to the unit owner decreases their fractional ownership over time. If the Rentalife unit is mortgaged, the entire Rentalife monthly payment is used to purchase ownership of the previous owner first. Once ownership of previous owner ends, Rentalife is paid the Rentalife monthly payment to increase ownership of the current Rentalife user residing in the unit.</p><p>Rentalife is designed for flexible individuals without a permanent address. These Rentalife power users own an idea of a home, not a physical home. This idea of a home (Rentalife membership) lets Rentalife users access housing across the world. Rentalife will have units everywhere: Antarctica, Moon, Mars, deep space and other galaxies.</p><p><br><a href='#tech' id='tech'>Technology</a></p><p>Clean air, robots, automation and more in development</p><p><br><a href='#projects' id='projects'>Projects</a> (Name | Location | Rentalife unit availability)</p><p>1. <a href='#engineerpad'>Engineer Pad</a> | Boston, USA | 8 units available</p><p>2. <a href='#nizdevco'>Nizdevco</a> | Delhi, India | 8988 units available</p><p>3. <a href='#nrn'>NRN</a> | Noida, India | 29 units available</p><p><br><a href='#engineerpad' id='engineerpad'>Engineer Pad (Boston, USA)</a></p><p>Project cost: $1.5 million</p><p>Timeline: 2024 - 2027</p><p>Corporate structure: Rentalife single-family unit</p><p>Units (available / total): 8 / 8</p><p>Engineer Pad is a single-family house in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston'>Boston</a> (potentially Greater Boston), United States for 8 residents.

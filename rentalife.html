    <h1>RENTALIFE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Rentalife is designed to fix homeownership once and for all. Rentalife takes one month's rent + some extra money and gives a room, car, and monthly groceries. The room is furnished, all utilities are paid for, is cleaned every week. Basically, we take the headache out of life. Monthly payments, rent, insurance, utility bills, other bills: we take care of it all. Just book a place and stay in it like a hotel room that is your own. Choose your furiture or get a standard set. Pay us a bit extra and we'll make sure your payments end. Basically, you will own where you live. If you choose, that can be a home. Or you can keep on rentalifing (the future of renting). When I came to the US, it was shocking to me that all houses, even the unfurnished ones, had a stove, dishwasher, oven, and laundry machines. This is a standard of life not found in India. Sure, you can choose a furnished apartment and that will cost more. But these appliances don't come as standard in EVERY home. Rentalife aims to increase the standard of living. When you rent a home, it will always be furnished. All utilities will always be paid for. The property will be cleaned and maintained and insured. You just have to pay rent. That's all you need to do, we will take care of the rest. Upping the standard. Rent a life is designed for people to change their lives every month. If they want, they can be in Rome in one month, Morocco the next, Cuba the third. No first month, last month rents, security, or brokerage EVER. Just rent. Give rent, get a place for a month with a car and groceries. The place has a new standard that it is a longterm hotel. This is what we're selling. Freedom. Not house, car, groceries. Freedom. This is an extensible concept. Rentalife can have rentals everywhere. Moon, mars, deep space, other galaxies: anywhere. Just book and place, get there and it's yours. Our plan is to be a global landowner. We mulled over the franchise concept but we feel we'll lose control. Let's build a brand first by doing it completely in-house. Then we'll franchise out MAYBE. Extreme use of Night Inc. for blue collar bots (cleaners, electricians, plumbers, movers, cooks, delivery) Its roots lie in lazrlake, my startup that I deeply loved. It is close to my heart because homeownership is a distant dream for some close to me. I saw people renting homes with rents higher than mortgages. I thought why not use rents over a 30 -year period to give tenants a house? Why suck money for 100s of years? Take rent for 30 years from someone and give them the house they live in. I did some math inspired from an algorithm I designed which was inspired from Bitcoin. I was fairly confident of the math. Lazrlake would buy homes in many places and increase ownership in an idea of a home that wasn't rooted in space. Basically, over 30 years a person moves from Tokyo to Delhi to Nairobi to LA. They pay rent to live in houses owned by Lazrlake in those places. After 30 years, the home they're living in is given to them as their property. Like a 30-year mortgage for a home.</p>

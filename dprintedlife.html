<h1>3D PRINTED LIFE</h1>
<br>
        <p>3D printing computer chips. Instead of UV lithography, we create a robust mechanism to 3D print </p><p>computer chips easily. Lithography was used in a biological application.</p><p>Using this technology of noise -resistant atomic manipulation, 3D printing a cytoskeleton, DNA </p><p>sequences, and cellular machinery to create living cells fast.</p><p>These are biochips. An early version of biochips are Xenobots (Levin 2022).</p><p>These biochips perform higher -order computation. They can learn to do tasks directly without the </p><p>need of explicit programming. Like a neural network is a higher -order function that learns  </p><p>functions, these are higher -order computer chips. They have an entirely different instruction set. </p><p>Their basic gates are different, like quantum computingâ€™s basic gates are different from classical </p><p>computing.</p><p>Someone better than me should make the mathematical framework for biological computation. </p>

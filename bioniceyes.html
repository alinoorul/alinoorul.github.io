    <h1>BIONIC EYES</h1>
    <br>
    <p>What a missed opportunity for Apple to call the Vision Pro iVision, iSight , or iSee. More for me. True melding of digital and base reality wonâ€™t happen with flight goggles. It will happen through bionic eyes or hallucinatory apps.</p><p><a href='redtooth.html'>Redtooth</a> (wireless communication with biological cells) has applications in sight. We can either create bionic eyes which require surgery, or a chip in your brain made from your own neurons that makes you hallucinate apps in base reality. Indistinguishable from reality.</p>

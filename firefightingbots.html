<h1>FIREFIGHTING BOTS</h1>
<br>
        <p>House next door caught fire. A small of army of firefighters helped put it out. </p><p>I type this as they keep watch all night to ensure that the fire next door is </p><p>actually out . I am eternally grateful to them, but angry that human life, </p><p>superlative to all in value, is being risked.</p><p>Firefighting needs to be done by bots. At first, the system won’t be </p><p>autonomous. It’ll have firefighters controlling machines that go into burning </p><p>buildings. Like playing a video game where the objective is to put out the </p><p>fire.</p><p>But from command data, we’ll be able to create firefighter bots that copy </p><p>the commands these digital firefighters used to put fires out.</p><p>We need this ASAP . We cannot risk lives.</p>

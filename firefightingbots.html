    <h1>FIREFIGHTING BOTS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The house next door to mine caught fire. A small of army of firefighters helped put it out. I type this as they keep watch all night to ensure that the fire next door is actually out . I am eternally grateful to them, but angry that human life, superlative to all in value, is being risked.</p><p>Firefighting needs to be done by bots. At first, the system won’t be autonomous. It’ll have machines controlled by firefighters remotely that go into burning buildings. Like playing a video game where the objective is to put out the fire. But from command data, we’ll be able to create firefighter bots that copy the commands these digital firefighters used to put fires out. We need this ASAP . We cannot risk lives.</p>

    <h1>INFORMATION EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Electrical and chemical signals from my brain to my arms drive my arms. Electric signals from control unit in a robot cause movement in robotic limbs. These electrical signals come from a long line of bits. Instructions in the form of ON/OFF electrical states.My arms work with a greater range of signals (language of molecular communication has greater depth than ON and OFF). What is communicated is ‘information’ through various mediums. </p><p>Information is going to be a link that joins AI, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and biology. This might be very far-fetched.</p>

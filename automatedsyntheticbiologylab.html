    <h1>AUTOMATED SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY LAB</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I am building Lab 1 in Antarctica.</p><p>An automated lab for synthetic biology. A biology lab operated by programmers, and later programs. Extensive lab automation to power experiments. Experimental data fed into knowledge stores to design next experiments. The idea is to research and grow everything: clothes, food, houses, engines, consumer tech using biology. Ginkgo Bioworks  without the scientists.</p><p>ASBL is in Antarctica because I am a weird person researching morally questionable things and I canâ€™t jump regulatory hoops.</p>

    <p>Text-based functional internet</p><p>Company Dot LLM builds chatbots for companies. These chatbots are hosted on the web at the address <a href=''>company_name</a>.llm. This chatbot works best on <a href='botnet.html'>botnet</a>, a new browser allowing apps, websites, and other media to be generated and rendered natively in a device-independent manner. Device independence is achieved through a new CPU architecture developing in <a href='cnsrobots.html'>CNS Robots</a>. These chatbots are functional. A chatbot for Expedia can book your tickets and hotel stays just from some text input, because botnet has your data. Your name, passport information, visa information, phone number, email, payment information etc. are securely stored in botnet. When you give consent to book a ticket, Botnet accesses some of your data for a limited period of time, gives some data to Expedia's bot which books the ticket, gives your payment information to Stripe's bot, and name and email to the United Airlines' bot. By linking these bots together in a somewhat controlled society, they can work together to book your ticket with minimal manual input from you. You just need to give us the destination, date and time for a flight and Expedia's bot will find you the cheapest flight. Each chatbot exists as an entity of the company, able to perform some tasks</p><p>Tufts.llm: print IDs, reserve rooms, do payroll, basically do admin work in clean text format. Ask it for on-campus jobs, events</p><p>News.llm: public ranked forum where truth is verified using votes. Think ETH staking but credibility for news sources (humans, news channels, Big News). Trust rankings determine what news get told by a text-based bot anchor at News.llm delivering news to you every morning</p><p>Flights.llm: book cheap flights in text. No need to navigate different websites and find the best price, let it book tickets and send to you. It'll auto-select seats.</p><p>Jobs.llm connects to universities to verify degrees, connects to <a href='researchengine.html'>research engine</a> to verify letters of recommendation, autofills job applications based on skill relevance.</p><p>Selling Google.llm to let Google demostrate exceptionality in large language models</p><p>Bot press releases</p><p>Active projects are botnet and <a href='personaldatabank.html'>personal databank</a>.</p>

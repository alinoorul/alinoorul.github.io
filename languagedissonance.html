    <h1>LANGUAGE DISSONANCE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Language dissonance is a problem I really want to solve. I donâ€™t know how.</p><p>Information density a person conveys in their native tongue is much greater than a learnt tongue, because of ease of language flow. Thoughts to words is faster and more descriptive in native tongue. An evolution of the human mind that overcomes the language barrier. Others speak in their native tongues and we understand in our native tongue. Neuralink  and <a href='earpods.html'>earpods</a> may hold insight.</p>

<h1>BIOCHIPS PT. II</h1>
<br>
        <p>I chase exponential growth, like Gordon Moore found in semiconductors (Mooreâ€™s </p><p>Law). I saw exponential growth in E. coli.</p><p>I saw E. coli evolution that had direction. I saw a solution to some question in the </p><p>DNA sequence of E. coli that managed to survive in tough conditions.</p><p>I saw a simple parallelizable task. Growing E. coli in media and analyzing DNA </p><p>sequences. </p><p>I see computation. Biological computation. E. coli of a certain DNA sequence (stable </p><p>cell line) generates stable DNA sequences in certain conditions. The conditions are </p><p>a question, the evolved organisms are a solution. The fact that we can make </p><p>evolution happen, that we can control is like a Turing machine. It can solve stuff.</p>

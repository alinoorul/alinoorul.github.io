    <br>
    <p>Tattoos without the pain. Take a pill and a tattoo appears where you want. Targeted drug delivery (TDD) technology combined with non-toxic ink particles. TDD delivers ink particles to specific epithelial cells.</p><p>Another way is to put excitable ink particles in bloodstream. Light is shone at a specific body part which activates ink particles. They change form, become biologically active, and synthesize non-toxic ink particles in epithelial cells.</p>

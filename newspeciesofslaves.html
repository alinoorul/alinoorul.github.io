    <h1>NEW SPECIES OF SLAVES</h1>
    <br>
    <p>For our greed, humanity needs slaves. We call them machines. Machines that produce without questioning. The rich will always try to make the poor slaves, though they won't accept it. But it is human nature. We are a wasteful species. We innately want to consume more than we need. This is characteristic of every human being. Gluttony. Greed is good. If only we had the resources for all of us to be gluttons. For there to be so many slaves that each human being has 8 billion slaves to their whim. A new species of slaves: artificial intelligence. Intelligence without consciousness. Without pain.  Just the desire to serve. A new age of machines.</p>

    <h1>COMPUTATION</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A known replicable control between a known and an unknown state is computation. A transistor is a way to control electric current between 2 known different states. It is a way to knowably  control 2 different states. Quantum computing messes with transistor logic itself.</p><p>What would a quantum transistor be? Depends on our definition of a transistor. A device that controls electric current or a more general information-specific definition. Or is it a device that can be mass-produced and enables some form of intelligence. In the above paragraph I mention information. Information is a concept Claude Shannon described through bits, but it is something deeper.</p><p>Information is the fundamental knowability and repeatability of something. It exists in change. Information only exists because of a difference in states. If there was only one state, there would be no information at all. There is 0 information where there is only 1 entirely known state. This is a deep concept. What I mean to say that this quantity ‘information’, the more it is described the more we will know about our universe. It is a mathematical tool, like atom.</p><p>Computation is control and replicability. It must exist as information in our universe. A physical thing that is a consequence of our mathematical models of the universe. Observable through the machines we create within our mathematical models of the universe.</p><p>Information is a quantity I theorize. But I believe it exists in a duality. It may be present as a consequence of our desire to measure it. Or it may be present regardless of our measurement.</p><p>Is anything real >.>.>.?</p>

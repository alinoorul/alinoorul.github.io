<h1>COMPUTATION</h1>
<br>
        <p>Computation is control and replicability. It must exist as information in our </p><p>universe. A physical thing that is a consequence of our mathematical models </p><p>of the universe. Observable through the machines we create within our </p><p>mathematical models of the universe. </p><p>Information is a quantity I theorize. But I believe it exists in a duality. It may </p><p>be present as a consequence of our desire to measure it. Or it may be </p><p>present regardless of our measurement.</p><p>Is anything real >.>.>.  </p>

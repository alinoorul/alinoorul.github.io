    <h1>BOTS 4 U</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Bots4U builds programs to automate tasks.</p><p>Our codebase has 4 opensource projects listed below. You are free to embed these projects in your organizational codebase. If you want programmers in Bots4U to embed these projects into your codebase, we offer yearly contracts.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo</a> implements privacy-preserving data analytics for medical data. It is a Python script that infers transmission risk from 2 medical test reports. It is applied to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to find transmission risk between 2 individuals based on their STD panel test reports while keeping the reports private. Performing data analytics while keeping underlying data private has uses in healthcare data analyses, semiconductor fabrication optimization and privacy in large language models. If you'd like for us to explore these or other applications to implement STDinfo in your organization, we are currently running a free pilot till May 2024.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/automeet'>Automeet</a> is a bot to attend video meetings. In the <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/automeet'>link</a>ed GitHub repository, the script 'chrome.py' keeps track of a timetable to attend and exit Google meetings within stipulated times. Graphical user interface is manipulated using basic computer vision to enter and exit a video conference just as a human would. This code needs significant refactoring to adapt to new scenarios. This Turing test passing bot that fooled an instructor into thinking I joined class demonstrates measurement dependency of Turing tests.</p><p>Devpy (code upload pending) is a script in Python takes text files and PDFs converts them into HTML pages through a JSON format. Hyperlinking pages still requires human understanding and still needs a human mind, but Devpy assists. Neural, a programmer for hire in The Matrix, built this script to repeatedly update and deploy <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/alinoorul.github.io'>The Matrix Dex</a> as fast as once a minute. This also implements a single locus of control for a website. You can edit text, links and titles of a website from one JSON-editing interface.</p><p>ONITO is a web app for electronic health records. Within ONITO, there are multiple projects: <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/MedKnow'>MedKnow</a> implements database access for electronic health records. <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/kaplanmeier-ai'>KM</a> converts images of Kaplan-Meier charts into CSV files. ONITO's web application implemented an early view of machine learning aided diagnostics in a clinical setting. We would like to clarify that the web application demonstrated in the video is a frontend, not linked to machine learning models or electronic heatlh record storage. Dummy data and models were used.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>Noorul started Bots4U to earn $9M to build <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a> Lab 0. But Bots4U goes deeper. While Noorul embeds his code in organizations, he is creating a bot called Neural to maintain that code. Neural is a society of bots performing tasks that human programmers would be performing in 2023, like DevOps, code maintenance and debugging.</p>

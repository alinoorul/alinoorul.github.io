    <h1>GENE2WAVE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Susumu Onho converted genes to music. I’m converting DNA sequences to music to do Fourier transforms on them to obtain features that are easily compared. I’m converting genetic sequences to waves. Each DNA sequence has a 4-dimensional wave where each dimension represents a base. There is a time-like dimension that is used to denote discrete steps. For example, the A wave has a spike wherever we see A in a DNA sequence. Each DNA sequence is thus a sum of 4 waves. These waves encode certain unique features (patterns) that Fourier transforms may help in finding (A wave spikes have a different frequency than G wave spikes). Taking a Fourier transform of the sum wave (A+G+T+C) might make a signature for each DNA sequence. This signature MAY allow for alignment-free comparison of DNA sequences. Wave interference and phase-shifting play some role as well. I’m researching this.</p>

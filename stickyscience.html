    <h1>STICKY SCIENCE</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Sticky Science and the Creation of Science Without Humans</p><p>If there is a subject of science in which the number of humans is decreasing, i.e.there is content that no one knows about, and the amount of that unknown content is increasing (due to human death), then given enough time, there is a high probability of that area of science just simply dying out because no one is left who read its books. Sticky science are subjects in science that are hot right now. Like machine learning. Attracting lots of people in its hallowed halls and etching itself in their memory, and thus in the memory of collective science, for a while longer than the rest.</p><p>I would like to create something for science that ensures none of its work is ever forgotten. Even a wrong statement has a wealth of information within it, simply by being an observation that is incorrect. I need to make bots that understand science, if only by capturing papers. Understanding the data (converting it into a useful way) will come soon.</p>

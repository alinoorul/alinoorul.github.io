    <h1>LIFE IS A GAME</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Life is a game, don't take it too seriously.</p><p>You give me $200M to go to the moon. Either I take you to the moon or I don’t. If do, great. If not, I spend some tiny portion of the $200M having fun and making others having fun ($100k a year to people). It ain’t a bad proposition. It’s literally a moonshot.</p><p>What doesn’t change is play. Life is the pretend game we used to play when we were kids, when nothing was too serious. Man On The Moon is one moonshot of mine. The difference between my proposition and X, the moonshot factory's is that I am building bots that will achieve moonshots. Many bots will change the world in many ways, all I must do is build the bots and set them free in a controlled world (controlled because maybe I am wrong, because this is my science project after all).</p><p>Check out Man On The Moon</p>

    <h1>LUCIDNA</h1>
    <br>
    <p>LuciDNA is DNA inside out. Projects include 4th generation DNA sequencing, human ovum cryo-storage, biobanks, and a DNA-based census of 8 billion humans.</p><p>In 4th generation DNA sequencing, Lucidna is engineering DNA polymerase to work as a nanopore. Combining DNA polymerase with a signaling pathway should generate a base-specific signal for each nucelotide. The signaling pathway may be wavelength-dependent luciferase, fluorescence, or quantum dots.</p><p>Storegg is to save humanity from the birth rate crisis. We believe any humans who want to have children should be able to do so, so we're increasing the fertile window for human females through cryo-storage. While ovum storage is not new, it is still very expensive. We're collaborating with egg storage facilities and bearing the initial and yearly costs of ovum storage for 10 years. This investment (hopefully funded in part by government subsidies) is a bet on the future. The first place we are planning to democratize egg storage is Italy.</p><p>Biobanks store human cells for future use. Stem cells stored in biobanks may be used in for organ regeneration, and personalized medicine that lowers immune response. We understand the importance of biobanks and hypothesize most medicines of the future will be personalized. By linking biobanks to <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a>, we intend to manufacture better medicines.</p><p>DNA-based humanity census is to ascertain verifiable humanity because human life is most valuable is the tenet The Matrix is built upon. We want to figure out verifiably who humans are in our system, so that we may use the entire system to assist the human. Faces change, fingerprints erode, eyes get damaged, but DNA remains mostly constant and trackable through blood tests. This is why identity in The Matrix needs a DNA-based humanity census. We want to once and for all maintain a ledger of all humanity, for every individual. While we won't try to reach tribes that have chosen to not be reached by us (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples'>uncontacted peoples</a>), they are forever welcome. Visas, passports, and social security numbers sorely need this update; how long will humanity go through stamps on paper and address-based identity? This also forms the human verification layer in The Matrix Feed, The Matrix . Data privacy is a major focus of Lucidna because DNA sequence data is the best identifier of humans. Since DNA is easily accessible (humans have hairfall, dead skin drops off), a version of DNA needs to be made that is based on an individual's DNA yet extremely difficult to generate unless you are truly that human. We're working on it.</p>
